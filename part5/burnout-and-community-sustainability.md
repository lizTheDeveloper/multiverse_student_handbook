# Burnout and Community Sustainability

## For Everyone in the Community

Burnout can happen to anyone - students, facilitators, peers. Understanding burnout helps you:
- **Recognize it in yourself** before you collapse
- **Understand why people (including facilitators) need boundaries**
- **Support others without sacrificing your own wellbeing**
- **Build sustainable community relationships**

**This is about horizontal relationships:** We all need sustainable engagement. No one can pour from an empty cup.

## Two Types of Burnout

Especially relevant for neurodivergent people, there are **two distinct but overlapping types** of burnout:

1. **General Burnout** — Exhaustion from chronic stress, overwork, emotional labor
2. **Autistic/Neurodivergent Burnout** — A distinct syndrome affecting autistic, ADHD, and other neurodivergent people

**Both can occur simultaneously.** Understanding the difference helps you identify what you need.

## Part 1: Autistic/Neurodivergent Burnout

### What Is Autistic Burnout? (AASPIRE Research)

From **AASPIRE** (Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education):

> **Autistic burnout is "a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports."**

**Characterized by:**
- **Pervasive, long-term exhaustion** (typically 3+ months)
- **Loss of function** (skills you had become unavailable)
- **Reduced tolerance to stimulus** (sensory, emotional, cognitive)

**Key insight:** Autistic burnout results from cumulative stress of navigating a predominantly neurotypical world without adequate support.

### The Six Facets of Autistic Burnout (AASPIRE ABM)

In 2024-2025, AASPIRE validated the **Autistic Burnout Measure (ABM)**, developed through community-based participatory research with autistic people.

**The ABM assesses six facets:**

1. **Decreased cognitive abilities**
   - Trouble thinking clearly, processing information, problem-solving
   - "Brain fog" or "cotton wool brain"

2. **Decreased emotional regulation**
   - Emotions more intense, harder to manage
   - Meltdowns or shutdowns more frequent

3. **Increased sensitivity**
   - Sounds, lights, textures become overwhelming
   - Social interactions feel painful
   - Emotional hypersensitivity

4. **Decreased everyday abilities**
   - Skills regress: cooking, cleaning, self-care, communication
   - Things that were "easy" become impossible

5. **Increased avoidance or withdrawal**
   - Canceling plans, isolating, going nonverbal
   - Can't face people or tasks

6. **Increased exhaustion**
   - Bone-deep tiredness that sleep doesn't fix
   - "I can't keep going"

**Research finding:** The ABM effectively differentiates between autistic people currently experiencing burnout and those who are not (92% accuracy).

### Signs You May Be Experiencing Neurodivergent Burnout

**You may be in autistic/ADHD/neurodivergent burnout if:**

- **Masking becomes unbearable** — You can't force the "normal" persona anymore
- **Skills regress** — Things you could do easily (communication, organization, self-care) become impossible
- **Sensory sensitivity spikes** — Environments that were tolerable are now excruciating
- **Executive function collapses** — Can't plan, respond to messages, keep track of tasks
- **Social interactions drain you completely** — Even brief interactions feel overwhelming
- **Recovery time lengthens** — Used to bounce back after socializing; now it takes days
- **Meltdowns or shutdowns increase** — Happening more frequently, less predictable
- **Loss of joy in things you loved** — The work or activities that once energized you now deplete you

**Critical distinction:** This isn't regular tiredness. This is **loss of skills and capacity** that were previously available.

---

### What Causes Neurodivergent Burnout

**Primary causes from research:**
1. **Chronic life stress** — Ongoing demands without adequate support
2. **Mismatch of expectations and abilities** — Being expected to function neurotypically
3. **Lack of adequate supports** — Accommodations you need aren't in place

**In learning communities specifically:**
- **Constant social performance** — Zoom calls, interactions, expectations
- **Sensory overload** — Screens, notifications, voices, environments
- **Masking** — Suppressing stims, forcing eye contact, performing neurotypical communication
- **Cognitive demands** — Learning, multitasking, rapid decision-making
- **Emotional labor** — Managing crises (your own or others') while regulating emotions
- **Lack of autonomy** — Can't always control pace, environment, or demands
- **Unpredictability** — Schedule changes, crises, tech issues

---

### Recovery from Neurodivergent Burnout (Evidence-Based)

**AASPIRE research suggests these recovery strategies:**

#### 1. Complete Rest
- Similar to post-exertional malaise: **rest is the primary recovery method**
- Not "take a weekend"—potentially weeks or months
- Permission to do NOTHING

#### 2. Reduced Cognitive Demands
- Stop multitasking
- Reduce decision-making
- Simplify your environment
- Say no to non-essential tasks

#### 3. Social Withdrawal (Intentional)
- This is protective, not problematic
- Reduce social obligations
- Cancel plans without guilt
- Go nonverbal when needed

#### 4. Empowerment and Control
- Reclaim autonomy where possible
- Set boundaries (even small ones)
- Choose your sensory environment
- Control your schedule

#### 5. Improved Self-Awareness
- Track your capacity (spoons, energy levels)
- Notice early warning signs
- Name what you need
- Stop before you collapse

#### 6. Energy Management
- Pace yourself (don't "push through")
- Build in recovery time
- Respect your limits
- Prioritize ruthlessly

**Key principle:** You can't "self-care" your way out of systemic inaccessibility. Recovery requires actual reduction of demands.

### Preventing Neurodivergent Burnout

**From neurodivergent perspectives (2024 research):**

**What helps:**
- **Accommodations that actually work** — Not just "awareness," actual structural changes
- **Reduced masking** — Permission to stim, communicate authentically, take sensory breaks
- **Flexible schedules** — Control over when/how you engage
- **Sensory-friendly environments** — Noise-canceling headphones, lighting control, quiet spaces
- **Communication accommodations** — Async preferred, explicit instructions, written follow-up
- **Peer support** — Other neurodivergent people who get it
- **Regular recovery time** — Built into life, not "if there's time"

**What doesn't help:**
- "Just practice self-care!" (toxic positivity)
- "Everyone gets tired" (minimizing)
- "Have you tried yoga?" (individual solutions to systemic problems)
- "You need to be more resilient" (ableism)

**Critical finding:** **Accommodations for yourself are not optional.** Many neurodivergent people advocate fiercely for others but don't request accommodations for themselves.

---

## Part 2: General Burnout (For Everyone)

### What Is General Burnout?

Burnout from chronic stress, characterized by:
- **Emotional exhaustion** — Feeling drained, depleted
- **Detachment or cynicism** — Disconnection from work/community
- **Reduced sense of accomplishment** — Feeling ineffective, helpless

**2024 statistics:**
- **78%** of people in helping/teaching roles report feeling stressed
- **79%** experienced symptoms of poor mental health due to work
- Burnout is at crisis levels across sectors

### The "Five Fires" People in Community Roles Face

From 2024 research on burnout in helping professions:

1. **Disillusionment** — The gap between ideals and reality
2. **Burnout** — Exhaustion from chronic stress
3. **Compassion Fatigue** — Reduced capacity to care after absorbing others' trauma
4. **Demoralization** — Feeling that good work is impossible in current conditions
5. **Moral Injury** — Forced to act against your values (e.g., harmful policies)

**Neurodivergent people are especially vulnerable** because they often:
- Feel deeply and show up big
- Care ferociously
- Keep pouring from an empty cup
- Blame themselves for systemic failures

---

### Signs of General Burnout

**Physical:**
- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Getting sick frequently
- Headaches, tension, body pain
- Insomnia or oversleeping

**Emotional:**
- Irritability, anger
- Anxiety, dread
- Feeling numb or detached
- Crying easily or inability to cry

**Cognitive:**
- Trouble concentrating
- Forgetfulness
- Difficulty making decisions
- Negative self-talk

**Behavioral:**
- Withdrawing from community
- Procrastination
- Reduced quality of engagement
- Using substances to cope

**Relational:**
- Snapping at others
- Loss of empathy
- Avoiding connection
- Resenting others' needs

---

### Preventing General Burnout: Individual Strategies

#### 1. Set Realistic Expectations
- You cannot save everyone
- "Good enough" is good enough
- Your worth ≠ your productivity or helpfulness

#### 2. Prioritize Actual Self-Care

**Not:**
- Bubble baths (though nice)
- "Treating yourself"
- Toxic positivity

**But:**
- Sleep
- Nutrition
- Movement you enjoy
- Saying no
- Therapy
- Boundaries

**From 2024 research:** Self-care is not self-improvement. It's "having a relationship with yourself grounded in gentleness, humor, and respect that includes strategies to soothe stress, set boundaries, and advocate for needs."

#### 3. Seek Support
- Peer support (other community members)
- Therapy or counseling
- Mentoring or coaching
- Friends/family outside the community

#### 4. Maintain Balance
- Hard stop times (no work/community after X pm)
- Days completely off
- Hobbies unrelated to learning/community
- Relationships outside of this space

#### 5. Reduce Emotional Labor
- Not every crisis is yours to solve
- Refer to appropriate resources (988, therapists, crisis services)
- Detach with compassion: "I care AND I'm not responsible for this"

### Why Facilitators Need Boundaries (And So Do You)

**Facilitators are just people.** They have:
- Limited time and energy
- Their own mental health needs
- Lives outside of Multiverse
- Capacity limits

**When facilitators set boundaries, they're:**
- Protecting their capacity to show up sustainably
- Modeling healthy relationships
- Preventing burnout so they can keep facilitating
- Caring for themselves AND the community

**Students also need boundaries:**
- You can't be everyone's primary support person
- You need time off from community
- You're allowed to say no
- Sustainable engagement benefits everyone

**Mutual aid ≠ self-sacrifice.** We help each other from a place of capacity, not depletion.

---

### Preventing Burnout: Community-Level Changes

**Individual strategies only go so far.** Burnout is often a systemic problem requiring community change.

**What helps communities stay sustainable:**
- **Reasonable expectations** — Not 24/7 availability
- **Actual support structures** — Not just "we care about self-care"
- **Flexibility** — Accommodations for different needs
- **Peer support** — Regular check-ins, shared responsibility
- **Clear policies** — So people aren't making impossible decisions alone
- **Distributed responsibility** — Crises aren't handled by one person
- **Recognition** — Acknowledge the work, not just the problems

---

## Recognizing the Difference

### Is This Neurodivergent Burnout or General Burnout?

**Neurodivergent Burnout:**
- Skills regress (things you could do, you can't now)
- Sensory sensitivity spikes
- Masking becomes impossible
- Social interaction feels painful
- Longer recovery needed (months, not days)

**General Burnout:**
- Emotional exhaustion, cynicism
- Still can function, but don't want to
- Detachment from work/community
- Feels more psychological than physical
- Improves with time off (days/weeks)

**Both:**
- Can coexist
- Can worsen each other
- Require different interventions

---

## When to Step Back

### Yellow Flags (Consider Reducing Engagement)
- You're consistently exhausted, not just occasionally
- Community feels burdensome, not energizing
- You're getting sick often
- You're snapping at people you care about
- Community engagement is affecting sleep, eating, relationships

### Red Flags (Take Immediate Break)
- Suicidal ideation
- Meltdowns/shutdowns multiple times per week
- Skills have significantly regressed
- Physical health issues from stress
- Can't get out of bed
- Substance misuse to cope

**It is okay to step back.** Your wellbeing matters more than any community or project.

## Recovery Protocol

### Step 1: Assess
- Which type(s) of burnout am I experiencing?
- What are my most urgent needs?
- What support do I have access to?

### Step 2: Reduce Demands
- Cancel non-essentials
- Ask for accommodations
- Reduce community engagement
- Take a break if needed

### Step 3: Rest (Really Rest)
- Not "productive rest" — actual rest
- Permission to do nothing
- No guilt

### Step 4: Rebuild Slowly
- Start with smallest possible tasks
- Increase gradually
- Watch for warning signs
- Adjust as needed

### Step 5: Implement Ongoing Prevention
- What needs to change long-term?
- What boundaries need to be in place?
- What accommodations do you need?

## Understanding Why Others Need Boundaries

**When someone (facilitator or peer) sets a boundary with you:**

**They might be:**
- Experiencing burnout and protecting capacity
- Preventing burnout by setting limits early
- Managing neurodivergent needs (sensory, social, cognitive)
- Modeling sustainable engagement
- Caring for themselves so they can care for community

**They are NOT:**
- Rejecting you personally
- Being mean or uncaring
- Discriminating against you
- Abandoning the community

**How to respond:**
- Respect the boundary
- Don't take it personally
- Recognize they're being transparent about limits
- Build a support network (don't depend on one person)

## Key Principles

1. **Neurodivergent burnout ≠ General burnout** — Different causes, different interventions
2. **Rest is not lazy** — It's the primary recovery method
3. **Individual strategies aren't enough** — Community-level change required
4. **Boundaries protect capacity** — For everyone, not just facilitators
5. **You can't pour from an empty cup** — Your wellbeing enables your participation
6. **It's okay to step back** — Your health matters more than any community
7. **Recovery is possible** — With appropriate support and rest
8. **Everyone needs sustainable engagement** — Facilitators AND students

---

## Horizontal Relationships and Burnout

**In liberatory learning communities:**

- **Facilitators** are transparent about their limits (they're just people)
- **Students** also need boundaries and sustainable engagement
- **Everyone** shares responsibility for community health
- **No one** should sacrifice wellbeing for community
- **Mutual aid** means sustainable support, not unlimited access

**We all get to:**
- Set boundaries
- Take breaks
- Say no
- Ask for accommodations
- Prioritize our wellbeing

**This isn't selfish - it's how sustainable community works.**

---

## Remember

**You cannot participate sustainably while burning out.** Recognizing burnout early, taking it seriously, and implementing recovery strategies protects your ability to engage with learning and community long-term.

**When facilitators (or anyone) set boundaries, they're practicing sustainable community care.**

> **Guiding principle:** Self-care is not optional—it's essential infrastructure for sustainable community. We all need boundaries, rest, and accommodations. Horizontal relationships mean respecting each other's limits.
