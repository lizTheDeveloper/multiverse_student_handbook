# Recognizing Unhealthy Dependency

## For Everyone in the Community

Unhealthy dependency (sometimes called trauma bonding) can happen in any direction:
- Student depending too much on a facilitator
- Peer depending too much on another peer
- Someone depending too much on you
- You depending too much on someone else

**This guide helps you:**
- Recognize when you're becoming unhealthily dependent
- Understand why facilitators maintain boundaries (to prevent this)
- Notice when someone is becoming unhealthily dependent on you
- Build healthier, more sustainable relationships

**Horizontal relationships require healthy interdependence, not dependency.**

---

## What Is Unhealthy Dependency?

**Unhealthy dependency** is a psychological attachment that forms through:
- Intense experiences (crisis, vulnerability, rescue dynamics)
- One person positioned as "rescuer" or "only source of support"
- Intermittent reinforcement (sometimes close, sometimes distant)
- Confusing intensity with intimacy
- Replication of traumatic relationship patterns

**Key distinction:** This is different from healthy mutual aid, mentorship, or appropriate community closeness.

**In community settings,** unhealthy dependency occurs when:
- One person becomes your ONLY source of support
- You can't function without a specific person's input
- Crisis becomes the way you maintain connection
- Boundaries feel like rejection or abandonment
- The relationship creates dependence instead of growth

---

## Why Trauma-Affected People Are Vulnerable

People with trauma histories often:
- **Have insecure attachment styles** — Anxious, avoidant, or disorganized
- **Confuse intensity with intimacy** — Drama feels like connection
- **Test relationships** — "Will you abandon me like others did?"
- **Seek rescue** — Looking for someone to save them
- **Replicate past dynamics** — Unconsciously recreate familiar patterns
- **Lack healthy relationship models** — Don't know what appropriate looks like

**Neurodivergent people** may be especially vulnerable because:
- Social isolation increases need for connection
- Difficulty reading social cues (may not recognize inappropriate closeness)
- Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) intensifies fear of abandonment
- Masking and social performance are exhausting—authenticity feels rare and precious

**If this is you:** You're not broken. These patterns make sense given what you've experienced. AND you can learn healthier ways of connecting.

## Common Patterns of Unhealthy Dependency

### Pattern 1: The Rescuer Dynamic

**What it looks like:**
- You position someone as your savior: "You're the only one who's ever helped me"
- You share escalating crises, often at vulnerable times (late night, weekends)
- You feel like you can't function without their input
- You create situations where they have to "rescue" you

**OR someone is doing this with you:**
- They say you're their only support
- They share crises specifically with you
- They seem unable to function without you
- You feel responsible for their survival

**Why it happens:**
- Learned that crisis = care
- Reenacting rescue fantasies
- Testing: "Will you stay even when I'm difficult?"
- Genuine need paired with maladaptive pattern

**Red flags:**
- One person feels responsible for another's survival
- Others comment on the "special" relationship
- Different treatment than other community relationships
- Intensity that feels uncomfortable or unsustainable

---

### Pattern 2: Idealization & Special Connection

**What it looks like:**
- "You're different from everyone else"
- "You really see/understand me"
- Excessive gratitude or praise (love-bombing)
- Wanting private communication, exclusive access
- Talking about the relationship as unique or soulmate-like

**OR:**
- Someone is putting you on a pedestal
- They're hurt when you treat them like other community members
- Jealousy when you help other people
- Language becomes inappropriately intense

**Why it happens:**
- Genuine appreciation mixed with unhealthy attachment
- Splitting (seeing someone as all-good, others as all-bad)
- Seeking the "perfect" person who understands
- Difficulty with appropriate boundaries

**Red flags:**
- Language becomes inappropriate ("soul friend," "only person who matters")
- Feeling hurt when not treated as "special"
- Jealousy over attention given to others
- Intensity that exceeds the actual relationship

---

### Pattern 3: Crisis Dependence

**What it looks like:**
- Frequent crises that only one person can solve
- Escalating when that person is unavailable
- Using crisis to maintain contact
- Threatening self-harm if boundaries are set

**OR someone is doing this to you:**
- Their crises conveniently occur when you're about to step back
- You feel manipulated (even if not conscious manipulation)
- You're afraid to set boundaries because of what they might do

**Why it happens:**
- Trauma teaches: crisis gets attention
- Attachment anxiety: "If I'm not in need, will you leave?"
- Maladaptive coping: creates external crisis to match internal distress
- Testing boundaries

**Red flags:**
- Crisis timing seems strategic (even if unconscious)
- Feeling manipulated or trapped
- Fear of setting boundaries
- One person's wellbeing completely affected by another's emotional state

---

### Pattern 4: Boundary Dissolution

**What it looks like:**
- Asking increasingly personal questions
- Sharing trauma/vulnerability to create intimacy
- Wanting to know everything about someone's personal life
- Treating someone like a best friend/therapist/family when the relationship is more limited

**OR:**
- Someone is pushing for more personal closeness than appropriate
- Conversations happen outside normal community contexts
- Blurred lines between community relationship and personal friendship

**Why it happens:**
- Doesn't understand appropriate boundaries
- Confusing warmth with personal closeness
- Seeking reciprocal vulnerability
- Trauma: boundaries were violated, so healthy ones aren't recognized

**Red flags:**
- Sharing more personal information than appropriate for the relationship
- Conversations moving to private channels excessively
- Others notice the blurred boundaries
- Feeling like the relationship has become something it shouldn't be

---

## Why This Is Problematic

### For the Person Depending:
- Prevents building broader support networks
- Reinforces unhealthy attachment patterns
- Sets up for devastating disappointment
- Doesn't learn healthy boundaries
- Keeps stuck in victim/rescue cycles
- Not learning to self-soothe or build capacity

### For the Person Depended Upon:
- Emotional exhaustion
- Burnout from unlimited access
- Can't maintain healthy boundaries
- Other relationships feel neglected
- Personal life affected
- Resentment builds

### For the Community:
- Others notice and feel less valued
- Creates hierarchy (special relationships vs. regular ones)
- Models unhealthy relationship patterns
- Uses disproportionate resources for one person
- Violates horizontal relationship principles

## How to Recognize You're Becoming Unhealthily Dependent

### Ask yourself:

- [ ] Is one person my primary (or only) source of support?
- [ ] Do I panic when they're unavailable?
- [ ] Do I create crises to get their attention?
- [ ] Do I feel like I can't function without them?
- [ ] Do I get jealous when they help other people?
- [ ] Do I test their boundaries to see if they'll "really" stay?
- [ ] Do I share crises primarily with them?
- [ ] Do I position them as uniquely able to help me?
- [ ] Do I feel abandoned when they set boundaries?
- [ ] Do I think about them constantly?

**If you answered yes to 3+ questions:** You may be developing unhealthy dependency.

## How to Recognize Someone Is Becoming Unhealthily Dependent on You

### Ask yourself:

- [ ] Do I feel uniquely responsible for their wellbeing?

## Why Facilitators Maintain Boundaries (Transparency)

**Facilitators are just people who:**
- Have limited time and energy
- Can't be primary support for students
- Need to distribute attention across many people
- Want to model healthy relationships

**Facilitators maintain boundaries to:**
- Prevent unhealthy dependency from forming
- Stay sustainable and avoid burnout
- Model what healthy professional relationships look like
- Ensure they can serve all students, not just one
- Avoid ethical violations
- Protect both themselves and students

**When facilitators set boundaries, they're:**
- Caring for the relationship (not rejecting you)
- Modeling healthy limits
- Being transparent about what they can offer
- Protecting their capacity to keep showing up

**This is why facilitators:**
- Set office hours
- Don't respond to crisis messages (refer to 988 instead)
- Don't process trauma with students
- Maintain same policies for everyone
- Don't become your personal friend/therapist

---

## How to Build Healthier Relationships

### 1. Diversify Your Support Network

**Instead of one person:**
- Multiple friends/peers
- Therapist or counselor
- Crisis support (988, hotlines)
- Family (if safe)
- Different people for different needs

**Ask yourself:** "If [person] was unavailable for a week, would I be okay?"

If the answer is no, your support is too concentrated.

---

### 2. Recognize Intensity ≠ Intimacy

**Intensity:** Crisis, drama, extreme emotions, rescue dynamics
**Intimacy:** Trust built over time, mutual vulnerability, consistent presence, healthy boundaries

**Trauma often teaches us that intensity = connection.** But sustainable relationships are built on trust, not crisis.

---

### 3. Practice Asking for Help Without Crisis

**Unhealthy:** Only reaching out when in crisis
**Healthy:** "Hey, can I talk through something I'm thinking about?"

**Unhealthy:** Escalating to get attention
**Healthy:** "I'm struggling and could use support"

**Unhealthy:** Positioning one person as savior
**Healthy:** "Can you help me think through options?"

---

### 4. Respect Boundaries (Even When They Hurt)

**When someone sets a boundary:**
- It's not rejection
- It's not abandonment
- It's not because you're "too much"
- It's them protecting their capacity

**Healthy response:**
- "Okay, I understand"
- Take space to process feelings
- Find other support
- Don't try to negotiate or test the boundary

**Unhealthy response:**
- Spiral into RSD
- Threaten self-harm
- Try to make them feel guilty
- Immediately replace them with another "special person"

---

### 5. Build Capacity for Self-Soothing

**Skills to develop:**
- Emotional regulation (therapy, DBT skills)
- Distress tolerance
- Self-compassion
- Grounding techniques
- Recognizing when you need professional help vs. peer support

**From research:** The goal isn't to never need help - it's to not need one specific person constantly.

---

## Responding If You Recognize the Pattern

### If You're Becoming Unhealthily Dependent:

**Step 1: Acknowledge it**
- No shame - this is a learned pattern
- It makes sense given your history
- You can change it

**Step 2: Diversify support**
- Find a therapist
- Build peer connections (multiple people)
- Use crisis resources (988) instead of one person
- Practice asking different people for different things

**Step 3: Respect boundaries**
- When someone sets a boundary, honor it
- Don't test or negotiate
- Use the boundary as information: "I need more support than this relationship can provide"

**Step 4: Work on attachment patterns**
- Therapy (especially for attachment trauma)
- Learn about secure attachment
- Practice healthy relationship skills

---

### If Someone Is Becoming Unhealthily Dependent on You:

**Step 1: Recognize the pattern early**
- Don't wait until it's deeply established
- Notice intensity, boundary tests, special treatment requests

**Step 2: Set boundaries clearly**

**Scripts:**
> "I care about your wellbeing. I can't be your primary support person - that's not sustainable. Let's talk about building your support network."

> "I notice you reach out mostly during crises. For crisis support, please call 988. I'm here for [specific limited way you can help]."

> "That's more personal than I'm comfortable with. Let's keep our interactions focused on [appropriate topic]."

**Step 3: Refer, don't rescue**

**Instead of:** Solving their crisis yourself
**Do:** "Here's the crisis line. Here's therapy referrals. Here are peer support resources."

**Step 4: Be consistent**
- Hold boundaries even when they're upset
- Don't make exceptions
- Model healthy limits

**Step 5: Get support**
- Don't manage this alone
- Talk to a facilitator if you're a student
- Talk to admin if you're a facilitator
- Debrief with peers

---

## When to Tell a Facilitator

**If you're experiencing unhealthy dependency (yours or someone else's):**

**Tell a facilitator if:**
- Someone is threatening self-harm when you set boundaries
- Someone is stalking you across platforms
- You feel unsafe
- Someone is ignoring repeated boundary setting
- You need support managing a difficult situation

**Facilitators have additional tools and authority to help manage these situations.**

---

## Scripts for Common Situations

### When someone says: "You're the only one who understands me"

**If it's directed at you:**
> "I'm glad you feel heard. I'm not the only person who can understand you, though. Let's talk about building a broader support network. Have you considered [therapy, peer support groups, other community connections]?"

**If you're saying this:**
- Notice the pattern
- This is a red flag for unhealthy dependency
- Challenge the belief: others can understand too

---

### When someone shares deep trauma unprompted:

> "Thank you for trusting me with that. I can hear it's affecting you. That's something to work through with a therapist. I'm [your role], not a counselor. Let's talk about how to get you connected to appropriate support."

---

### When someone contacts you outside boundaries:

> "I don't respond to messages after [time]. Please reach out during [appropriate times]. If it's urgent, here are crisis resources."

---

### When someone wants special exceptions:

> "I apply the same approach to all my relationships here. Here's what I can offer within those boundaries."

---

### When they imply you're keeping them alive:

> "I hear that you're struggling. That's exactly why you need professional support—someone trained in crisis care. Here's the 988 number. Please call them if you're not safe. I care about you AND I'm not equipped to be your crisis support."

---

## Healthy vs. Unhealthy Relationships

### Healthy Mutual Aid:
- Multiple sources of support
- Can function when someone is unavailable
- Same access/availability as others
- Clear role boundaries
- Feels energizing (even if sometimes difficult)
- Supports growth and autonomy
- Boundaries are respected

### Unhealthy Dependency:
- One primary source of support
- Can't function without that person
- Special treatment/availability
- Blurred roles (friend, therapist, savior)
- Feels intense, draining
- Creates dependence, not growth
- Boundaries trigger crisis

---

## Key Principles

1. **Intensity ≠ intimacy** — Drama isn't connection
2. **Diversify support** — Don't put all needs on one person
3. **Boundaries are care** — For everyone involved
4. **Refer, don't rescue** — Connect to appropriate help
5. **Consistent boundaries** — No special treatment
6. **Early intervention** — Notice patterns before they're deeply established
7. **Seek support** — Don't handle alone

## Remember

**People who become unhealthily dependent aren't "bad" or "manipulative"—they're often replicating the only relationship patterns they know.**

**The goal is to learn something different:**
- Care with boundaries
- Warmth with structure
- Support with limits
- Interdependence, not dependence

**This applies to everyone - students, facilitators, peers.**

**In horizontal relationships, we all practice:**
- Distributing our support needs across multiple people
- Respecting each other's boundaries
- Building capacity for self-soothing
- Referring to appropriate resources
- Caring sustainably

---

## Quick Self-Check

**Healthy relationship:**
- Warm, supportive, boundaried
- Can function when they're not available
- Same availability as others
- Clear role boundaries
- Feel energized (even if sometimes challenged)
- Supports growth and autonomy
- Multiple sources of support

**Unhealthy dependency:**
- Intense, exclusive, unboundaried
- Can't function without them
- Special treatment/availability
- Blurred roles
- Feel responsible for their survival (or they for yours)
- Creates dependence
- One primary source of support

> **Guiding principle:** Mutual aid means interdependence, not dependence. We help each other from a place of capacity, not from one person rescuing another. We all need multiple sources of support.
