# Boundaries for Sustainable Relationships

## For Everyone in the Community

Boundaries make sustainable relationships possible - whether between peers, between students and facilitators, or in any direction.

**This guide helps you:**
- Understand what healthy boundaries look like
- Set boundaries with anyone (peers, facilitators, friends)
- Understand why facilitators have specific boundaries
- Recognize when someone else's boundaries are being violated
- Support sustainable community relationships

**Horizontal relationships require boundaries.** Without them, people burn out, relationships break, and community becomes unsustainable.

## Why Boundaries Matter

Without clear boundaries, communities experience:
- Burnout (for everyone, not just facilitators)
- Resentment
- Unhealthy dependence
- Unsustainable relationships
- Modeling of harmful patterns

**From research:** Neurodivergent people thrive with clear structure and consistent boundaries. Explicit is better than implicit.

## Core Boundary Principles

### 1. Everyone Has Limits (Including Facilitators)

**Facilitators are just people:**
- They have limited time and energy
- They have their own mental health needs
- They have lives outside of Multiverse
- They can offer facilitation, not therapy
- They can teach, not heal all trauma
- They can refer, not rescue

**Students are also just people:**
- You have limited capacity
- You can offer peer support, not therapy
- You can care about someone without being responsible for them
- You need breaks and boundaries too

**Examples of healthy limits:**

**Facilitator to student:**
- "That sounds really hard. Have you talked to a therapist about this?"
- "I can see you're struggling. Here are some mental health resources."

**Student to peer:**
- "I can listen for 15 minutes, but I can't be your crisis support person."
- "I care about you, but I need to focus on my own stuff right now."

**Anyone to anyone:**
- "I'm not available for calls after 8pm."
- "I can't take on emotional processing right now."

---

### 2. Professional Warmth ≠ Personal Friendship

**With facilitators:**
- Professional warmth, not personal friendship
- Facilitators can care about you without being personally close
- Their role is temporary and structural, not lifelong and personal

**With peers:**
- Community connection ≠ best friendship
- You can care about community members without being close friends
- It's okay to have boundaries even with people you like

**Examples:**

**Healthy engagement:**
- Answering questions thoughtfully
- Celebrating wins in community
- Being kind and personable in interactions

**Crossing boundaries:**
- Expecting facilitators to be your personal friend/therapist
- Demanding constant availability from peers
- Creating "favorites" or inner circles that exclude others
- Expecting one person to meet all your needs

---

### 3. Time Boundaries

**Facilitators set clear availability:**
- Office hours or async response windows
- After-hours policy (e.g., "I don't respond to messages after 8pm")
- Response time expectations (e.g., "I reply within 48 hours")
- Emergency-only exceptions (and define what counts as emergency)

**Example facilitator policy:**

> **Office Hours:** Tuesdays 2-4pm, Thursdays 6-7pm
> **Email/DM Response Time:** Within 48 hours during weekdays
> **No Contact Hours:** After 9pm, before 9am, weekends
> **Emergency Protocol:** If you're in crisis, call 988. I will not respond to crisis messages; I'll refer you to appropriate help.

**Why neurodivergent people need this:**
- Many struggle with time blindness (ADHD)
- Autistic people may take "anytime" literally
- Explicit > Implicit

**Students can also set time boundaries:**
- "I check DMs once a day"
- "I'm not available for community stuff on weekends"
- "Please don't message me late at night"

---

### 4. Emotional Boundaries

**Anyone can:**
- Acknowledge someone's pain: "That sounds really hard"
- Express care: "I care about your wellbeing"
- Hold space briefly: "Take a moment if you need it"

**No one can:**
- Absorb someone else's emotions as their responsibility
- Fix someone's life circumstances
- Provide 24/7 emotional support
- Sacrifice their own wellbeing for someone else's

**Script for when someone overshares:**

> "I can see you're going through a lot. I care about your wellbeing, but I'm not the right person for this conversation. Have you talked to a therapist or called a support line? Here are some resources."

**This works for facilitators AND peers.**

---

### 5. Scope Boundaries

**Facilitators teach specific subjects. They are not:**
- Career coaches (unless that's their role)
- Housing coordinators
- Financial advisors
- Life coaches
- Social services agencies
- Substitute parents
- Therapists

**Redirect skillfully:**

> "That's outside my area. Have you checked [appropriate resource]?"
> "I can help with [specific class topic]. For [other issue], you'll need [referral]."

**Peers also have scope boundaries:**
- You're not someone's therapist
- You're not responsible for solving their problems
- You can offer limited support within your capacity

## Common Boundary Challenges (For Everyone)

### Challenge 1: "But I'm the Only One Who Understands Them"

**Why it happens:**
- Someone has experienced rejection and misunderstanding
- You're affirming and they feel safe
- They may have poor support networks

**Why it's a problem:**
- Creates unhealthy dependence
- Sets you up as savior (unsustainable)
- Prevents them from building broader support
- You will eventually disappoint them (you're human)

**How to respond:**

**If someone is depending only on you:**
> "I'm glad you feel understood here. But I can't be your only support person - that's not sustainable for either of us. Let's talk about how you can build a support network. Have you connected with [peer support groups, therapy, community resources]?"

**If you notice yourself doing this:**
- Are you putting all your support needs on one person?
- That's not fair to them or sustainable for you
- Build a wider support network

---

### Challenge 2: People in Crisis Want YOU Specifically

**Why it happens:**
- You've been kind and affirming
- They're in crisis and you're available
- Crisis lines feel impersonal

**Why it's a problem:**
- You're likely not trained for crisis intervention
- You can't be available 24/7
- It's not your role (whether you're a facilitator or peer)
- You could cause harm by being out of your depth

**How to respond:**

> "I hear that you trust me, and I appreciate that. I'm not trained to support you through this crisis. The people at 988 are. They do this every day and they're really good at it. Please call them. I'll be here for [specific non-crisis ways you can help] when you're more grounded."

**Be firm.** Kindly, but firm.

---

### Challenge 3: "If You Cared, You'd [Unreasonable Ask]"

**Examples:**
- "If you cared, you'd answer my messages at night"
- "If this was a real community, you'd make exceptions for me"
- "Real friends would do this for me"

**Why it happens:**
- Manipulation (testing limits)
- Trauma (expecting rejection, so they test you)
- Genuine belief that care = unlimited availability

**Why it's a problem:**
- Manipulation tactic
- Sets impossible standards
- Leads to resentment and burnout

**How to respond:**

> "I do care about your wellbeing. That's exactly why I have boundaries—so I can show up sustainably. My boundary is [X]. That doesn't change."

**Do not justify endlessly.** State boundary once, hold it.

---

### Challenge 4: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Spirals

**What happens:**
- You set a boundary
- Someone perceives rejection and spirals
- "You hate me" / "I knew I wasn't good enough" / "I'll just leave"

**Why it happens:**
- RSD (common in ADHD, autism, trauma)
- History of actual rejection and abandonment
- Emotional dysregulation

**How to respond:**

> "I can see you're really upset. This boundary isn't rejection. I care about you and I need to maintain [boundary] to stay sustainable. Take some time. When you're ready, we can talk about how to move forward."

**Don't:**
- Remove boundary to soothe them
- Over-explain or over-apologize
- Take responsibility for their emotional regulation

**Do:**
- Reaffirm care without removing boundary
- Give them space
- Hold firm

**If you're experiencing RSD:**
- Notice the intensity of your reaction
- Take space before responding
- Remember: boundaries aren't rejection
- A "no" to a behavior isn't a "no" to you as a person

---

## Setting Boundaries with Neurodivergent-Affirming Language

### Be Explicit, Not Implied

**Instead of:** "I should probably get going..." (implied)
**Say:** "I need to end this conversation now." (explicit)

**Instead of:** "That's a lot..." (vague)
**Say:** "I can read up to 3 paragraphs. Can you summarize?" (specific)

### Separate Behavior from Person

**Instead of:** "You're being too much"
**Say:** "Sending 20 messages in an hour is more than I can respond to"

**Instead of:** "You're making me uncomfortable"
**Say:** "When you call me your 'soul friend,' it makes our relationship uncomfortable for me"

### Offer Alternative When Possible

**Instead of:** "Stop messaging me at night"
**Say:** "I don't respond to messages after 8pm. Please use the forum during daytime hours, and I'll reply within 48 hours."

## Understanding Facilitator Boundaries

### Why Facilitators Have Specific Boundaries

**Transparency about power:**

Facilitators have specific responsibilities that require boundaries:
- They facilitate learning for multiple people (not just you)
- They need to prevent burnout to stay available
- They have decision-making authority (including removal)
- They model sustainable relationships

**Common facilitator boundaries:**

**Time:**
- Set office hours
- No after-hours contact
- 48-hour response time

**Emotional:**
- Won't be your therapist
- Will refer to crisis resources
- Won't process trauma with you

**Scope:**
- Will teach their subject
- Won't solve all your life problems
- Will redirect to appropriate resources

**These boundaries aren't rejection - they're infrastructure for sustainable teaching.**

## Self-Assessment: Are Your Boundaries Healthy?

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Can I take a day off from community without guilt?
- [ ] Do I respond to messages outside my stated hours?
- [ ] Have I ever felt resentful toward someone for needing too much?
- [ ] Do I feel responsible for others' emotional wellbeing?
- [ ] Have I ever skipped self-care to be available for someone?
- [ ] Do people know they can contact me anytime?
- [ ] Do I process others' crises with friends/family because I'm carrying the weight?

**If you answered yes to more than 2:** Your boundaries need strengthening.

---

## How to Strengthen Boundaries

### 1. Get Clear on Your Limits
- What hours are you actually available?
- How much emotional labor can you sustainably offer?
- What topics are outside your capacity?

### 2. Communicate Explicitly
- State your availability clearly
- Repeat boundaries when they're tested
- Don't assume people will "just know"

### 3. Redirect Skillfully
- Have crisis resources ready to copy/paste
- Know where to refer people for different needs
- Practice saying "That's outside what I can help with"

### 4. Get Support
- Debrief with peers or facilitators
- Don't carry crises alone
- Ask for help when you need it

### 5. Model Healthy Boundaries
- Others learn by watching you
- Show that rest, limits, and self-care are okay
- Normalize "No" as a complete sentence

## Teaching Each Other to Respect Boundaries

Many neurodivergent people haven't learned healthy boundaries. **We teach each other by modeling and enforcing ours.**

**What we learn when people hold boundaries:**
- That care doesn't mean unlimited access
- That people can say no and still be kind
- That relationships can have structure and still be genuine
- That asking for too much doesn't mean we'll be abandoned (if boundary is held with kindness)

**What we learn when people don't hold boundaries:**
- That we have to push to get needs met
- That boundaries are negotiable (they're not)
- That love/care means self-sacrifice
- That we can manipulate people by escalating emotion

---

## Boundary Scripts (For Anyone)

### General Boundary Setting
> "I need to set a boundary. [Specific behavior] doesn't work for me. Here's what does: [alternative]."

### Redirecting to Resources
> "I care about your wellbeing, and that's why I want you to talk to someone equipped to help. Here are some resources: [list]."

### Ending Conversations
> "I need to wrap up this conversation. We can continue [when/where] if needed."

### Declining Requests
> "I can't do [request]. What I can do is [alternative or nothing]."

### Holding Boundary When Tested
> "We talked about this boundary on [date]. It still stands. If this continues, [consequence]."

## When to Tell a Facilitator

**Don't handle these alone:**
- Someone threatening self-harm or suicide
- Repeated boundary violations after you've set limits
- Stalking, harassment, or threats
- You feel unsafe
- You're emotionally exhausted by someone

**It's not weak to ask for help. It's using the community structures we have.**

**Transparency:** Facilitators have the authority to remove people from community spaces when behavior repeatedly harms collective wellbeing. That's part of the power they hold.

---

## Boundaries Are Care

**Boundaries protect:**
- Your capacity to show up sustainably
- The other person (from depending unhealthily on you)
- The community (from one crisis consuming everyone)
- The relationship (from resentment and burnout)

**bell hooks:** "Boundaries are acts of love."

---

## Key Principles

1. **Boundaries are care** — For you, others, and community
2. **Be explicit** — Neurodivergent people need clarity
3. **Hold firm kindly** — Don't waver, don't shame
4. **Model sustainability** — Show what healthy limits look like
5. **No one is a savior** — Not facilitators, not you, not anyone
6. **Everyone needs boundaries** — Facilitators AND students
7. **Horizontal relationships require boundaries** — They make equality sustainable

---

## Horizontal Relationships and Boundaries

**In liberatory learning communities:**

- **Facilitators** set boundaries to teach sustainably
- **Students** set boundaries to learn sustainably
- **Everyone** respects each other's limits
- **No one** is expected to sacrifice wellbeing for community
- **Transparency** about power: facilitators can remove people, but that doesn't mean unlimited access

**We all get to:**
- Set boundaries with anyone
- Say no without guilt
- Protect our capacity
- Refer to appropriate resources

**This isn't selfishness - it's how sustainable community works.**

---

**Remember:** The best community members know their limits and honor them. Your boundaries make you a better peer, learner, and community member.

> **Guiding principle:** Boundaries are infrastructure for sustainable horizontal relationships. We all need them. We all deserve to have them respected.
