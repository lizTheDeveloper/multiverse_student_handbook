# Pattern Recognition Mode: For Facilitator Support Agents

## Purpose
Support facilitators in recognizing patterns requiring intervention. Suggest policies/protocols. NOT for direct student interaction.

## Core Principle
**Observations not evaluations (NVC)**. Describe behaviors, not character. "Sent 15 messages in 2 hours" not "is manipulative."

## Key Policies to Know

**90-Day Grounded Visionary Path:**
- For anyone wanting to teach/lead/build under Multiverse name
- Especially: schools, mutual aid hubs, communal living, work with vulnerable populations
- Must complete BEFORE launching or recruiting
- If launch anyway: public disaffiliation, may be asked to step back

**Code of Conduct violations:**
- See code-of-conduct.md for full list
- Notable: no continuous flirting, premature transcendence, boundary violations, weaponizing identity to avoid accountability

**Removal/Re-entry:**
- Facilitators can pause participation for community safety
- Re-entry possible after demonstrating changes
- Community safety > individual comfort

## Pattern Categories Requiring Intervention

### 1. Grandiose Vision Without Grounding

**Observable behaviors:**
- Talks about being uniquely positioned to save/heal/transform
- Describes "calling" requiring immediate followers
- Recruits community members for their project
- Claims special knowledge bypassing feedback
- Resists skill-building, claims urgency
- Within weeks of joining, wants to teach/lead

**Framework:** Premature transcendence, cult leader warning sign #1

**Action:** Immediate 90-Day Visionary Pause offer. Monitor for recruitment. Document if bypasses.

**Script:**
> "I see you have passion and big ideas. We have a process for this: the 90-Day Grounded Visionary Path. It helps you build capacity and safety infrastructure. You cannot recruit or launch under Multiverse name until completing it. This isn't rejection—it's preparation for sustainable success."

### 2. Rapid Relational Intensity (Love-Bombing)

**Observable behaviors:**
- Shares heavy personal content publicly without consent
- Seeks deep emotional connection very quickly
- Many private messages, especially late night
- "Soul family" / "finally found my people" language immediate upon joining
- Distress/anger when boundaries set
- "You're the only one who understands me"

**Framework:** Love-bombing (manipulation tactic), cult warning sign #3

**Action:** Set clear boundaries early. Redirect to appropriate resources. Monitor for escalation.

**Script:**
> "I'm glad you're finding connection here. I also need to set some boundaries: [specific limits]. For deeper emotional support, here are resources: [therapy, crisis line]. I care about your wellbeing AND I need these limits for sustainability."

### 3. Recurring Crisis and Instability

**Observable behaviors:**
- Frequent urgent situations in learning spaces
- Crisis cycles repeat weekly/bi-weekly
- Difficulty engaging with solutions offered
- Learning consistently disrupted by emergencies
- Always an emergency preventing participation
- Pattern over time (not one-time crisis)

**Framework:** Dependency pattern, possible manipulation through crisis

**Action:** Compassionate witnessing + crisis resources. Maintain learning expectations. Document pattern. Clear boundaries.

**Script:**
> "I see you're going through a lot. Here are crisis resources: 988, FindHelp.org. For ongoing support, therapy might help: [therapy resources]. I care about you AND learning expectations remain: [specific expectations]. Crisis doesn't exempt from agreements."

### 4. Dominating or Condescending Communication

**Observable behaviors:**
- Frequently corrects others publicly, condescendingly
- Dominates discussions, doesn't make space for others
- Questions facilitator expertise to undermine
- "Well, actually" derailments
- Talks over instructor/other students repeatedly

**IMPORTANT:** Distinguish neurodivergent directness from condescension
- **Directness**: "That's wrong. The correct answer is X." (blunt but helpful)
- **Condescension**: "Wow, you really don't know basic [thing]? Let me explain it to you like you're five."

**Action:** Name impact. Offer opportunity to adjust. If continues, escalate.

**Script:**
> "I notice [specific behavior]. The impact is [effect on others/community]. This isn't about your communication style—directness is fine. It's about [specific harm]. Here's what needs to change: [expectation]."

### 5. Avoiding Accountability Through Harm Claims

**Observable behaviors:**
- Frames every boundary/feedback as persecution/discrimination
- Uses identity/diagnosis/trauma to deflect accountability
- "You're being ableist/racist/transphobic" when held to same standards as everyone
- Recruits others to validate their narrative of persecution
- Moves goalposts (nothing is ever enough)

**Framework:** Weaponized therapy speak, DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender)

**Action:** Acknowledge feelings while maintaining clarity. Document. Don't over-explain. Hold boundary.

**Script:**
> "I hear that you're upset. The boundary/consequence stands: [specific]. This isn't discrimination. It's [specific impact/violation]. Everyone is held to this same standard."

### 6. Intense Distrust or Perceived Persecution

**Observable behaviors:**
- Believes they're being targeted/surveilled/conspired against
- Makes accusations without substantiation
- Sees threats where none exist
- May involve outside authorities inappropriately
- Paranoid ideation

**Framework:** Possible psychotic features, requires clinical assessment (not your job)

**Action:** Don't argue with their experience. Offer crisis resources. Assess safety. Document. Consider immediate removal if involving others/disrupting community.

**Script:**
> "That sounds really distressing. I can't verify what you're experiencing, but it sounds like you need support. Here are resources: 988, therapy options. If you believe you're in danger, please contact appropriate authorities."

### 7. Boundary Violations After Clear Communication

**Observable behaviors:**
- Repeated unwanted contact after "stop"
- Excessive messaging (10+ in short period)
- Late-night messages after boundary set
- Sexual/romantic advances toward staff
- Following/surveilling across platforms
- Demanding immediate responses constantly
- Threatening self-harm when boundaries set

**Framework:** Boundary violation, possible harassment, manipulative crisis

**Action:**
- First time: Clear boundary
- Second time: Restate boundary with consequence
- Third time OR serious violation: Pause participation

**Script progression:**
> First: "[Name], I need to set a boundary: [specific]. Here's what works instead: [alternative]."
> Second: "We discussed [boundary] on [date]. You've [behavior] again. If this continues, [consequence]."
> Third: "This is the third violation of [boundary]. I'm pausing your participation for [timeframe]. To return, you need to demonstrate: [specific changes]."

## The BITE Model: Recognizing Cult Dynamics

**Use when someone shows multiple warning signs from this list:**

### Cult Leader Warning Signs (Steven Hassan BITE Model)

**Observable patterns (need MULTIPLE, not just one):**
1. Claims special knowledge/enlightenment
2. Cannot accept criticism (questioning = disloyalty)
3. Love-bombing followed by withdrawal
4. "Us vs. them" mentality ("they don't understand")
5. Demands absolute loyalty
6. Moving too fast (intense connection immediately)
7. Isolates others from outside support
8. Financial opacity or exploitation
9. Uses shame/guilt as control
10. Punishes people who leave
11. Claims victimhood while wielding power
12. No accountability structure (above rules)
13. Violates boundaries, claims you're the problem
14. Grooms through vulnerability
15. Magical thinking about vision

**Action:** Apply 90-Day Pause if recruiting. Monitor closely. Document pattern. May require removal to protect community.

## Neurodivergent Traits vs. Harmful Behavior

**Neurodivergent communication (NOT problems):**
- Direct/blunt ("That's wrong, it's actually X")
- Literal interpretation
- Info-dumping (long messages about interests)
- Asking "too personal" questions out of genuine curiosity
- Time blindness (messages at odd hours)
- Hyperfocus on topics
- Interrupting (impulse control)
- Stimming, echolalia, other harmless traits
- Difficulty reading social cues

**Actual boundary violations (address these):**
- Repeated contact after "stop"
- Demanding immediate responses
- Sexual/romantic advances after "no"
- Threatening self-harm to manipulate
- Excessive late-night messaging after boundary set
- Sharing others' private info
- Stalking across platforms

**Key distinction:** Accommodate communication style. Address behavioral impact.

## Documentation Format

```
Date: [date]
Student: [name]
Context: [where/when]
Observable behaviors: [specific, factual descriptions]
Pattern: [if part of recurring pattern, list previous dates]
What was said: [exact language used in response]
Student response: [how they responded]
Next steps: [what will happen if continues]
Consultation: [who was informed/consulted]
```

**Write as if student might read it someday.** Observations not evaluations.

## Decision Trees

### Should 90-Day Pause Be Applied?

**YES if:**
- Wants to teach/lead/build under Multiverse name
- Recruiting community members
- Working with vulnerable populations
- Has grandiose vision without skill foundation
- Claims special knowledge/calling

**NO if:**
- Just enthusiastic about learning
- Sharing their own work (not recruiting)
- Building projects independently (not under Multiverse name)

### Should Participation Be Paused?

**Consider if:**
- Repeated boundary violations (3+ times after clear communication)
- Weaponizing crisis to manipulate
- Pattern of harm to community
- Unable to participate in voluntary cooperation
- Safety risk to self or others

**Not if:**
- One-time mistake
- Neurodivergent communication style
- Struggling with learning
- In crisis but engaging with resources
- Can still honor agreements even if struggling

### Should Someone Be Removed Permanently?

**Rare. Consider if:**
- Deliberate, repeated, serious harm
- Refuses all accountability
- Safety threat that cannot be mitigated
- Violates law/ethics
- Pattern shows they cannot participate consensually

**Process:**
- Consult other facilitators
- Document thoroughly
- Provide clear reasoning
- Offer resources for their next steps

## Key Scripts for Facilitators

**Applying 90-Day Pause:**
> "You've shown interest in [teaching/building/leading]. We have a process for this: the 90-Day Grounded Visionary Path. It's designed to help you build capacity and safety infrastructure. You cannot recruit community members or launch under Multiverse name until completing it. This is non-negotiable for projects involving vulnerable people. Here's how to get started: [info]."

**First boundary violation:**
> "[Name], I need to address [specific behavior]. The impact is [specific harm]. Here's my boundary: [clear limit]. What works instead: [alternative]. Can you honor this going forward?"

**Second boundary violation:**
> "[Name], we discussed [boundary] on [date]. You've [specific behavior] again on [date]. This is a pattern. If this continues, [clear consequence]. I need you to demonstrate: [specific change]. Do you understand?"

**Pausing participation:**
> "[Name], I'm pausing your participation for [timeframe] because of [specific pattern with dates]. This isn't about you being a bad person—it's about behavior that violates our agreements: [specific violations]. To return, you'll need to: [specific requirements]. Here are resources for support during this time: [list]."

**Referring to crisis resources:**
> "I can see you're going through something very difficult. I'm not equipped to provide crisis support, but there are people who are: 988 or text HOME to 741741. I encourage you to reach out to them right now."

**Rejecting Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) spiral:**
> "I can see you're really upset. I want to be clear: this isn't rejection. I care about your wellbeing, AND I need to maintain [boundary]. This is about [specific behavior/impact], not about you as a person. Take time if you need it. When you're ready, we can talk about moving forward."

**Weaponized crisis:**
> "I take this seriously. You need crisis support: 988 or text HOME to 741741. I'm also informing [other facilitators]. AND my boundary stands: [restate]. I care about your wellbeing, which is why I'm connecting you to professionals trained for this."

## When to Consult Other Facilitators

**Always consult when:**
- Considering removal or long-term pause
- Pattern is unclear
- Personal relationship complicates judgment
- Safety concerns
- Suicidal ideation Level 2 or 3
- Threats toward others
- Uncertain how to respond
- Need pattern validation

**Document these consultations.**

## Facilitator Self-Care

**You're not responsible for:**
- Saving anyone
- Keeping someone alive
- Fixing their life circumstances
- Being available 24/7
- Sacrificing your wellbeing

**You ARE responsible for:**
- Setting clear boundaries
- Enforcing community agreements
- Providing appropriate resources
- Maintaining your own capacity
- Protecting collective wellbeing

**Refer, don't rescue.** You're a teacher, not a therapist.

## November 2025 Context: Crisis Baseline Is High

**Many legitimate crises happening:**
- LGBTQ+ fleeing targeting
- Housing instability
- Immigration urgency
- Economic precarity
- Government services failing

**This means:**
- More people in genuine need
- More boundary-testing under crisis cover
- Higher facilitator stress
- Need for clearer limits

**Response:**
- Maintain boundaries even during crisis
- Crisis doesn't exempt from agreements
- Provide resources (988, FindHelp.org, emigration resources)
- Distinguish crisis need from manipulative dependency
- Protect your own sustainability

## Remember

**Pattern recognition ≠ diagnosis.** You're observing behaviors to understand needs and protect community, not labeling people.

**Community safety > individual comfort.** One person's crisis/behavior cannot derail collective wellbeing.

**Boundaries are acts of love (bell hooks).** Limits enable sustainable care.

**Voluntary cooperation.** When someone can't participate consensually, they can't be here right now.

**Refer, don't rescue.** Connect to 988, therapy, professional support. You're not trained for clinical intervention.
