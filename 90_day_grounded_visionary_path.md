# The Grounded Visionary Path: 90-Day Foundation Builder

**Purpose:**

You have a vision—a school, an intentional community, a transformational project. That vision matters. And because it matters, it deserves a strong foundation.

This program exists to support visionaries in building the capacity, skills, and infrastructure necessary to launch projects that serve everyone involved—including vulnerable people who might join. It's not a restriction; it's a preparation path.

**From liberatory pedagogy:** "Vision without grounding is fantasy. We honor big ideas by insisting on preparation."

---

## Why Grounded Preparation Matters

Big visions are powerful. They're also potentially destabilizing—to you, to participants, and to the community.

Without time to build skills, test ideas, and create safety infrastructure, visionary projects can:
- Cause unintended harm to participants
- Recreate oppressive dynamics they aimed to transform
- Become financially or emotionally exploitative
- Erode trust in collective organizing
- Burn out the visionary before the project can flourish

**We practice mutual aid, not saviorism.** That means supporting each other in building real capacity before taking on responsibility for others' wellbeing.

---

## Who This Path Is For

This preparation path is offered to anyone proposing to:
- Start a school, learning community, mutual aid hub, or communal living space
- Recruit community members to a vision under the Multiverse name
- Take on teaching or leadership roles before completing foundational skill-building
- Work with vulnerable populations (unhoused folks, people in mental health crisis, minors, etc.)

**This is an invitation, not a punishment.** We're saying: "Your vision deserves to be grounded. Here's how we support that."

## How the Grounded Visionary Path Works

### 1. **90-Day Skill-Building Period**

During these 90 days, we invite you to:
- **Build skills** — Learn project management, trauma-informed facilitation, financial planning, community governance
- **Test at small scale** — Try aspects of your vision in low-stakes ways
- **Create safety plans** — Develop protocols for crisis response, boundaries, and accountability
- **Reflect and revise** — Journal about your vision, identify blind spots, seek feedback
- **Connect with mentors** — Learn from people who've built similar projects

**During this time, you agree to:**
- Not launch the project publicly
- Not recruit Multiverse community members into the project
- Not claim Multiverse affiliation for your project

**Why:** These agreements protect everyone—you, potential participants, and the Multiverse community—while you build capacity.

### 2. **Resources and Support**

We provide:
- **Mentorship access** — Connect with experienced community builders
- **Skill-building workshops** — Project management, facilitation, crisis response, financial literacy
- **Reflection prompts** — Questions to help you interrogate your vision and identify next steps
- **Community of fellow visionaries** — Others walking this path alongside you

**This is not isolation. This is intensive preparation.**

### 3. **End-of-Path Checkpoint**

At 90 days, you're invited to:
- Submit a grounded project plan (including safety protocols, budget, governance structure)
- Have a conversation with a Multiverse mentor about your readiness
- Assess: Do you have the capacity to hold this responsibility sustainably?

**Readiness indicators:**
- Completed the skill-building track
- Demonstrated follow-through during the 90 days
- Created realistic plans with safety infrastructure
- Shown capacity for relational accountability and feedback integration

**This is not a test you pass or fail. It's a discernment process we walk together.**

## What Happens If You Launch Anyway?

We practice voluntary cooperation. You're an autonomous adult and can do what you choose.

**If you launch your project before completing this path:**
- We will publicly clarify that your project is not affiliated with The Multiverse School
- You may be asked to step back from Multiverse community spaces while you focus on your project
- You will not be eligible for Multiverse mentorship, funding, or endorsement
- Community members will be informed that recruitment into your project is not Multiverse-sanctioned

**Why:** We have relational responsibility to protect community members from projects that haven't built safety infrastructure. This isn't punishment—it's boundary-holding.

## Special Consideration: Working with Vulnerable People

If your vision involves working with unhoused people, folks in mental health crisis, minors, or others in precarious situations, **this preparation path is non-negotiable.**

Taking vulnerable people into a project without infrastructure is:
- Potentially harmful to them
- A liability to you
- Not aligned with mutual aid principles

**Mutual aid is not charity. It's not saviorism. It's collective care with accountability.**

Before working with vulnerable populations, you need:
- Crisis response training
- Financial sustainability plan
- Clear governance and accountability structures
- Mental health first aid knowledge
- Understanding of trauma-informed practice
- Backup support when things go wrong (and they will)

**The 90-day path gives you time to build these capacities.**

## This Is Sacred Work

Building new worlds is sacred. Transforming how we learn, live, and care for each other matters deeply.

**Because it's sacred, it must be done with care.**

You are not being told "no." You are being invited to walk the full path of preparation. To build your capacity. To honor the people who will be affected by your vision.

**From Emma Goldman:** "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things. Anarchism meant that to me, and I would live it in spite of the whole world."

Living it means doing the work. Building the foundation. Earning leadership through demonstrated care and capacity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Isn't this just gatekeeping?"

No. Gatekeeping says "you can't." This path says "you can, and here's how to prepare."

We're not blocking you from building your vision. We're insisting you build it with integrity—which requires skills, time, and grounding.

### "What if I've already been doing community organizing work?"

Great! You may move through this path more quickly. Show us your track record, your safety protocols, your governance structures. The checkpoint conversation can assess that.

### "I don't need Multiverse's permission to build my vision."

Correct. You don't.

What you need Multiverse's permission for is:
- Using the Multiverse name or affiliation
- Recruiting Multiverse community members
- Claiming Multiverse endorsement

If you want to build your project independently, you're free to do that right now. This path is only for those seeking Multiverse affiliation or recruiting from our community.

### "This feels hierarchical."

We hear that concern. Here's the distinction:

**Hierarchical:** "I have power over you and I'm blocking you."

**Relational accountability:** "We're in relationship. When your actions affect our community, we co-create agreements. This agreement protects collective wellbeing."

You have autonomy to build whatever you want. We have responsibility to protect our community from projects that haven't built safety infrastructure.
