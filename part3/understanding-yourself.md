# Understanding Yourself: Mental Health Patterns

## You're Not Broken

Your brain might work differently. You might struggle with things others find easy. You might have patterns that cause you pain.

**This doesn't make you broken.** It makes you human.

Understanding your patterns helps you work with your brain, not against it.

### Context: November 2025 - Trauma Responses to Collective Crisis

**A lot of people are experiencing intensified distress right now.** This isn't necessarily individual pathology - it might be **normal human response to living through fascism, government shutdowns, targeting of minorities, and resource scarcity.**

**What you might be experiencing:**
- Rational fear responses (when the government is making lists of people like you)
- Trauma responses (to ongoing threat and violence)
- Grief (for what's being lost)
- Terror (justified by the situation)
- Exhaustion (from trying to survive while everything falls apart)

**You're not broken. The situation is.**

That said, understanding your patterns still helps. And if you need to flee, that might be the best intervention available right now.

## Recognizing Your Patterns

### Keeping a Mental Health Journal

**Track:**
- Mood (rate 1-10)
- Sleep (hours, quality)
- Energy
- Anxiety level
- What happened today
- Triggers
- What helped

**Why:**
- See patterns over time
- Identify triggers
- Notice early warning signs
- Share with therapist/doctor

**Apps:**
- Daylio (mood tracking)
- Bearable (symptom tracking)
- Moodpath (mental health assessment)

---

## When Multiple Things Are Happening

### Comorbidity

**Common combinations:**
- Depression + anxiety
- ADHD + anxiety
- PTSD + depression
- ADHD + autism
- Eating disorder + depression/anxiety
- Bipolar + anxiety
- Substance use + almost anything

**This is normal.** Mental health conditions often occur together.

**Treatment:** Address both/all. Sometimes treating one helps the others.

## Getting Assessed

### Why Get Assessed?

- Understand what you're experiencing
- Get appropriate treatment
- Access accommodations (school, work)
- Validate your experience

### Who Can Assess?

- **Psychiatrist** (MD/DO)
- **Psychologist** (PhD/PsyD)
- **Neuropsychologist** (comprehensive testing for ADHD, autism, learning disabilities)
- **Licensed therapist** (for some conditions)

### Cost

- With insurance: Copay ($20-100 typically)
- Without insurance: $500-5000 depending on type of assessment
- Some community health centers offer low-cost assessments

**See:** [Therapy Resources](../part7/therapy-resources.md) for finding affordable assessment

---

## Self-Diagnosis

### Is Self-Diagnosis Valid?

**For some conditions, yes.** Especially:
- Autism (barriers to formal diagnosis are real)
- ADHD (if you can't afford assessment)
- Depression/anxiety (if you're using self-knowledge to seek help)

**Barriers to formal diagnosis:**
- Cost
- Geographic access
- Bias (doctors dismiss women, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ people)
- Fear of discrimination

**Self-diagnosis is valid when:**
- You've done thorough research
- You're using it to understand yourself and seek support
- You're not using it to harm others

**Self-diagnosis is not enough when:**
- You need medication (need professional diagnosis)
- You need accommodations (may need formal diagnosis)
- You're not sure (professional assessment helps)
