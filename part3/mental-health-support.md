## When Therapy Isn't Working

### Red Flags

**Find a new therapist if:**
- They don't listen
- You feel judged
- No progress after 6+ months
- They violate boundaries
- They push their values on you
- You don't feel safe

**It's okay to:**
- "Fire" a therapist
- Try multiple therapists before finding the right one
- Switch modalities

### Getting More Support

**If outpatient therapy isn't enough:**

**IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program)**
- 3-5 days/week, several hours/day
- More support than weekly therapy
- Still live at home

**PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program)**
- 5-7 days/week, full days
- Hospital-based but go home at night

**Residential Treatment**
- 24/7 care
- For severe cases
- Eating disorders, trauma, substance use, etc.

**Inpatient Hospitalization**
- Short-term (3-7 days typically)
- For crisis stabilization

### What Self-Care Can't Do

**Self-care cannot:**
- Replace therapy or medication for serious mental illness

### What Self-Care Can Do

**Self-care can:**
- Support your mental health alongside treatment
- Help you cope day-to-day
- Prevent some crises
- Make life more bearable

### Actual Self-Care

**Not just bubble baths. Real self-care:**

**Physical:**
- Sleep (7-9 hours)
- Movement (whatever you can manage)
- Eating regularly
- Water

**Mental:**
- Boundaries
- Saying no
- Reducing stressors when possible
- Therapy/medication/support

**Social:**
- Connection (even when you don't want to)
- Asking for help
- Mutual aid

**Practical:**
- Paying bills on time (reduces stress)
- Doctor appointments
- Safe housing
- Financial stability when possible
