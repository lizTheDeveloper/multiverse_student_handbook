# De-escalation & Conflict Navigation

## For Everyone in the Community

This guide provides specific language anyone can use in difficult situations - whether you're a student navigating conflict with a peer, setting a boundary with a facilitator, or a facilitator responding to crisis.

**These tools are for horizontal relationships, not top-down management.**

All scripts are:
- **Neurodivergent-affirming** — Clear, direct, no hidden meanings
- **Trauma-informed** — Grounding, not shaming
- **Evidence-based** — Drawn from crisis intervention and peer support research

**Remember:** Scripts are starting points, not rigid formulas. Adjust for context and your authentic voice.

---

## General Principles for De-escalation

### Do:
- **Stay calm** — Your tone sets the tone
- **Use short, clear sentences** — Especially important for neurodivergent people in crisis
- **Validate feelings** — "I hear that you're upset"
- **Separate person from behavior** — "That comment was hurtful" not "You're a hurtful person"
- **Offer choices when possible** — Restores sense of control
- **Name what you're doing** — "I'm going to pause this conversation for safety"

### Don't:
- **Argue with delusions or extreme emotions** — You won't win
- **Take it personally** — Their crisis is not about you
- **Make promises you can't keep** — "I'll fix this" or "Everything will be fine"
- **Use sarcasm or implied meaning** — Be literal and direct
- **Escalate your tone** — Match their volume or intensity

## Scenario 1: Someone Is in Emotional Crisis

### Signs:
- Crying, panic, overwhelming distress
- Incoherent messages
- "Everything is falling apart"
- Not immediately dangerous but clearly struggling

### Script: Grounding Response (Anyone Can Use This)

> "I can see you're going through something really hard right now. I want to help, but I'm not equipped for crisis support. Are you safe right now? Do you have someone with you?"

*[Wait for response]*

> "I'm going to share some crisis resources with people who are trained to help in these moments:
> - 988 Lifeline (call or text)
> - Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
>
> You don't have to handle this alone. Can you reach out to one of these right now?"

*[If they resist or say "I just need to talk"]*

> "I hear that you need connection. I care about your wellbeing, and that's exactly why I want you to talk to someone who can really support you through this. I'm [a peer/a facilitator], not a crisis counselor. Please reach out to one of those lines, and I'm here for [specific ways you can help] when you're more grounded."

**If you're a facilitator:** You'll also notify admin and document the situation. This protects everyone.

**If you're a student/peer:** You can let a facilitator know someone is struggling, but you're not responsible for managing their crisis.

---

## Scenario 2: Setting a Boundary (First Time)

### Signs Someone Might Be Crossing Your Boundaries:
- Late night messages
- Excessive DMs
- Overly personal questions
- Inappropriate tone or content
- Demanding too much of your time/energy

### Script: Clear Boundary Setting (For Anyone)

> "[Name], I need to set a boundary. [Specific behavior] isn't sustainable for me. Here's what works instead: [Alternative]."

**Examples:**

**Peer to peer:**
> "I notice you've messaged me 10 times today. I can't respond to DMs constantly. Can you post questions in the forum instead? I check that once a day."

**Student to facilitator:**
> "I appreciate your feedback, but the way you phrased [X] felt hurtful to me. Can we talk about how to communicate differently?"

**Facilitator to student:**
> "I can't respond to DMs after 8pm. Please post questions in the forum during daytime hours, and I'll respond within 48 hours."

**Anyone to anyone:**
> "That question is more personal than I'm comfortable answering. Let's keep our conversations focused on [topic/learning goals]."

> "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but calling me [intense nickname] makes me uncomfortable. Can we keep it to [simple name]?"

---

## Scenario 3: Boundary Violation (Repeated)

### Signs:
- You've already set a boundary once
- They're continuing the same behavior
- May be testing limits or unable to adjust

### Script: Boundary with Consequence (For Anyone)

> "[Name], we talked about [specific boundary] on [date]. You've [specific repeated behavior] again. This is a problem."
>
> "Here's what needs to happen: [Clear expectation]. If this continues, [Clear consequence]."

**Examples:**

**Peer to peer:**
> "We discussed that I can't be your primary support person. You've called me during my work hours three times this week about personal crises. I care about you, but I need you to stop. If this continues, I'll need to take space from our friendship."

**Student to facilitator:**
> "We talked about you responding to my work within 48 hours. It's been a week. This is the third time. I need a clear commitment or I need to know this space won't work for me."

**Facilitator to student:**
> "I asked you not to share personal trauma in the main channel. You did it again yesterday. I get that you're processing a lot, but this space isn't equipped for that. Please use the crisis resources I shared, and keep class discussions on topic. If this continues, you'll be muted."

**Transparency:** Facilitators have the power to remove people from the community when behavior repeatedly harms collective wellbeing. This isn't punishment - it's protecting the learning space.

## Scenario 4: Someone Expresses Suicidal Ideation

### Signs:
- "I don't want to be here anymore"
- "What's the point of anything"
- Explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or death

### Script: Immediate Crisis Response (Anyone Can Use This)

> "Thank you for telling me. I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You deserve help right now."
>
> "This is beyond what I can support with, but there are people available 24/7 who can help you stay safe:
> - 988 Lifeline (call or text)
> - Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
>
> Can you contact one of them right now? Or is there someone with you who can help you make that call?"

*[If they say "I'm not going to do anything, I just needed to vent"]*

> "I'm glad you're not in immediate danger. And also, talking about suicide is serious, so I still want you to connect with someone trained in crisis support. Please reach out to 988 or Crisis Text Line today."

*[After providing resources]*

> "I'm going to pause our interaction here so you can get the right kind of help. We'll check in after you've connected with support."

**If you're a facilitator:** Escalate to admin immediately, document everything, don't attempt to "talk them down" yourself.

**If you're a student/peer:** Let a facilitator know if you're comfortable doing so, but you're not responsible for managing this alone. Your role is to care and refer, not to rescue.

---

## Scenario 5: Delusional or Paranoid Behavior

### Signs:
- Claiming they're being hacked, stalked, or surveilled (without evidence)
- Believing they have special powers or divine mission
- Accusing others of conspiracies
- Psychotic symptoms

### Script: Don't Argue with Delusion (For Anyone)

> "That sounds really stressful and scary. I can't verify what's happening, but it sounds like you could use someone to talk to about your safety."
>
> "Here are some resources with trained listeners:
> - 988 Lifeline
> - Crisis Text Line: 741741
>
> I also encourage you to talk to a doctor or therapist if you haven't recently."

**Don't say:**
- "That's not real"
- "You're being paranoid"
- "No one is targeting you"

**Do say:**
- "I hear that feels real to you"
- "I can't confirm that, but I want you to be safe"
- "Let's focus on getting you connected to support"

**If you're witnessing this:** You can suggest resources and let a facilitator know. Facilitators may need to pause someone's participation if their behavior is disrupting the community.

---

## Scenario 6: Aggressive or Threatening Behavior

### Signs:
- Insults, name-calling
- Threats toward you, others, or themselves
- Hostile tone, all-caps, aggressive language

### Script: Pause and Contain

**If you're experiencing this:**
> "I'm pausing this conversation for safety. [Specific behavior] is not okay here."
>
> "We can revisit this when everyone can communicate respectfully. In the meantime, if you need support, here are resources: [crisis numbers]."

*[Then:]*
- Step away from the interaction
- Notify a facilitator if in a community space
- Document with screenshots if needed

**If you're a facilitator:**
- Mute or remove from channel
- Notify admin
- Document with screenshots

**If they threaten violence:**

> "I'm taking this seriously. I'm ending this interaction and notifying [facilitator/admin/appropriate authorities]. If you're in crisis, please call 988 or go to your nearest emergency room."

**Transparency about power:** Only facilitators have the authority to remove people from community spaces. If you're experiencing threats, tell a facilitator. If you're a facilitator experiencing threats, escalate to admin.

---

## Scenario 7: Someone Demands Special Treatment

### Signs:
- "Why do they get [accommodation] but I don't?"
- "You're discriminating against me"
- "I need you to [unreasonable request]"
- Using identity or diagnosis to demand exceptions

### Script: Firm and Fair (Anyone Can Use)

> "I hear that you'd like [what they want]. Here's what I can do: [realistic option]. Here's what I can't do: [boundary], because [brief reason]."

**Examples:**

**Facilitator to student:**
> "I understand you want me to review your work tonight. I can give feedback within 48 hours during business hours. I can't do same-day turnarounds for everyone—that's not sustainable."

**Peer to peer:**
> "I hear that you need support. I can chat for 15 minutes now. I can't be on the phone for hours - that's beyond what I can give."

**Anyone to anyone:**
> "I hear that you're frustrated. The community guideline about [X] applies to everyone, including you. If you need accommodations for [specific neurodivergent need], let's talk about what would actually help within our structure."

> "Calling this discrimination doesn't change the boundary. [Specific expectation] is required for everyone's safety and the integrity of the learning space."

---

## Scenario 8: Love-Bombing or Intensity

### Signs:
- "You're the only one who understands me"
- "You saved my life"
- Excessive gifts, praise, or declarations
- Rapid intimacy

### Script: Redirect Intensity (Anyone Can Use)

**If someone is being intense with you:**
> "I appreciate that you value [this space/our connection]. I have limits on how available I can be. I can't be [your therapist/your only support/available 24/7]."
>
> "I encourage you to build relationships with multiple people. Here are some peer support resources: [links]."

**For excessive praise:**
> "Thank you—a simple 'thanks' is enough. You don't need to perform gratitude here."

**If you notice yourself doing this:** Notice the pattern. Are you putting all your support needs on one person? That's not sustainable for them or you. Build a wider support network.

---

## Scenario 9: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Response

### Signs:
- Extreme emotional reaction to mild feedback
- Perceiving criticism where none was intended
- Spiraling after a boundary is set
- "You hate me" / "I'm terrible" / "I should just leave"

### Script: Reaffirm Care Without Removing Boundary

**If someone is spiraling:**
> "I can see that you're really upset. I want to be clear: this isn't rejection. I care about your wellbeing, and I also need to maintain [specific boundary]."
>
> "Feedback on [work/behavior] is not feedback on you as a person. You're valued here. And also, [specific expectation] still stands."

*[Give them space]*

> "Take some time if you need it. When you're ready, we can talk about how to move forward."

**If you're the one experiencing RSD:**
- Notice the intensity of your reaction
- Take space before responding
- Remember: boundaries aren't rejection
- A "no" to a specific behavior isn't a "no" to you as a person

**Don't:**
- Remove the boundary to soothe their feelings (or ask someone to remove theirs)
- Over-apologize ("I'm so sorry I upset you!")
- Argue about whether they should feel hurt

**Do:**
- Stay grounded
- Separate behavior from identity
- Reaffirm care while holding boundary

## Scenario 10: Someone Wants to Build/Lead Too Soon

### Signs:
- "I want to start a school/community/movement"
- Recruiting within Multiverse
- Hasn't done groundwork
- Bypassing structure

### Script: Redirect to 90-Day Pause (For Facilitators)

> "I can see you have big ideas and a lot of passion. That's great. We also have a process to support people who want to lead or build: the 90-Day Visionary Incubation Track."
>
> "It's designed to help ground your vision and make sure it's safe and sustainable. You can't recruit or launch under the Multiverse umbrella until you complete it."
>
> "This isn't rejection—it's containment for safety. Vision without grounding is fantasy. We care about what you build."

*[If they resist]*

> "I understand you're eager to move forward. The pause is non-negotiable. If you choose to launch without completing the process, you won't be affiliated with Multiverse and we can't support you."

**If you're a peer experiencing recruitment:** You can say "I'm not interested" or let a facilitator know if it feels pressuring.

**If you're the visionary:** See [So You Want to Build a School](../so_you_want_to_build_a_school.md) for the structured path forward.

## Quick Reference: Tone & Body Language (for in-person or video)

- **Voice:** Calm, steady, slightly slower than usual
- **Volume:** Match or go slightly quieter than theirs (don't yell back)
- **Posture:** Open, non-threatening (uncross arms, face them)
- **Eye contact:** Offer, but don't demand (especially with autistic people)
- **Space:** Give physical distance if possible
- **Breathing:** Model slow, deep breaths

---

## After De-escalation: Self-Care (For Everyone)

De-escalating conflict is exhausting - whether you're a facilitator, a peer supporting someone, or the person who was in crisis.

After any intense interaction:
1. **Debrief with someone** — Process what happened (peer, facilitator, therapist, friend)
2. **Document if needed** — Write it down while it's fresh, especially for boundary violations
3. **Take a break** — 15 minutes minimum before next task
4. **Check your body** — Drink water, stretch, breathe
5. **Release responsibility** — You did what you could; the outcome isn't all on you

**From peer support research:** Helpers need help too. Don't carry this alone.

**If you're a facilitator:** You have additional responsibility to notify admin and document safety incidents. That's part of the power you hold.

---

## Understanding Power in These Scripts

**Let's be transparent:**

**Facilitators have power to:**
- Remove people from community spaces when behavior harms collective wellbeing
- Escalate to admin
- Enforce community guidelines
- Document safety incidents

**Everyone has power to:**
- Set and hold boundaries
- Refer to crisis resources
- Name when behavior is harmful
- Step away from unsafe situations
- Request facilitator intervention

**No one should:**
- Act as someone's therapist
- Take sole responsibility for someone's crisis
- Sacrifice their wellbeing to "help" someone
- Ignore threats or dangerous behavior

---

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity over comfort** — Be direct, not vague
2. **Validate feelings, hold boundaries** — Both can be true
3. **You're a bridge, not a clinician** — Redirect to appropriate help
4. **Document and escalate when needed** — Use the structures we have
5. **Boundaries are care** — For you, the other person, and the community
6. **Horizontal relationships require mutual accountability** — Anyone can set boundaries with anyone

---

## Community Co-Leadership in Action

These tools work because we all share responsibility for community health. Facilitators aren't the only ones who can de-escalate, set boundaries, or support someone in distress.

**We're co-creating a learning space together.**

That means:
- You can name when something isn't working
- You can set boundaries with peers and facilitators
- You can support others AND have limits
- You can ask for help when you need it

**Transparency:** Facilitators have specific responsibilities (removal authority, documentation, escalation protocols). But the day-to-day work of healthy community happens peer-to-peer.

---

**Remember:** The best de-escalation is prevention. Clear expectations, early boundaries, and neurodivergent-affirming communication reduce most crises.
