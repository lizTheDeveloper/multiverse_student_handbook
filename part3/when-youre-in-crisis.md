# When You're in Crisis

## You Don't Have to Be in Crisis Alone

If you're reading this because you're in active crisis—suicidal thoughts, panic attack, overwhelming distress, thoughts of harming yourself or others—**please reach out for immediate support.**

You deserve help. You deserve to be here.

### Context: November 2025

**A lot of people in our community are in crisis right now.** This isn't because something is "wrong" with you - it's normal human response to living through fascism, government shutdowns, targeting of minorities, and resource scarcity.

What looks like "extra mental health problems" is actually: **trauma responses, grief, terror, exhaustion, and the strain of trying to survive while everything falls apart.**

You're not broken. The situation is.

**If you need to leave the country:** See [Emigration Resources](../part7/emigration-resources.md)

## What Crisis Feels Like

Crisis can look different for everyone. You might be in crisis if:

**Thoughts:**
- Suicidal thoughts (passive: "I wish I weren't here" or active: "I have a plan")
- Thoughts of harming yourself
- Intrusive thoughts you can't control
- Complete hopelessness
- "There's no way out"

**Feelings:**
- Overwhelming panic
- Unbearable emotional pain
- Numbness/disconnection from reality
- Rage you can't control
- Terror

**Physical:**
- Panic attack (heart racing, can't breathe, feeling like you're dying)
- Dissociation (feeling unreal, watching yourself from outside)
- Severe physical pain that won't stop

**Behavior:**
- Already harmed yourself
- About to harm yourself
- Can't function (can't eat, sleep, move)
- Isolating completely
- Giving things away, saying goodbye

**If any of these are happening, you're in crisis. Reach out.**

3. **Get to a safe space** - Away from means of self-harm
4. **Ground yourself** (see grounding techniques below)
5. **Go to an ER if needed** - Emergency rooms can help in psychiatric crisis

## Grounding Techniques (When You're Panicking/Dissociating)

### 5-4-3-2-1 Technique

Name:
- **5 things you can see** (blue pen, window, tree outside...)
- **4 things you can touch** (table, your jeans, cold water...)
- **3 things you can hear** (traffic, birds, your breathing...)
- **2 things you can smell** (coffee, soap, fresh air...)
- **1 thing you can taste** (gum, water, mint...)

This brings you back to your body and the present moment.

### Physical Grounding

- **Hold ice** - In your hand, on your face. The cold interrupts panic.
- **Cold water** - Splash on your face, drink slowly
- **Strong physical sensation** - Snap a rubber band on wrist, squeeze a stress ball hard
- **Move your body** - Walk, jump, shake your arms
- **Breathe slowly** - In for 4, hold for 4, out for 6 (repeat)

### Mental Grounding

- **Count backwards from 100 by 7s** (100, 93, 86...)
- **Name categories** - "Countries starting with A: Afghanistan, Albania..."
- **Describe your surroundings in detail** - "I'm in a room with beige walls, a wooden desk..."

## When You're Suicidal

### What You Need to Know

**Suicidal thoughts are a symptom, not a character flaw.** They mean you're in unbearable pain and your brain is trying to escape it. They don't mean you're weak or broken.

**Suicidal thoughts ≠ wanting to die.** Often they mean "I want this pain to stop and I can't see another way."

**Suicidal crises pass.** The intensity you feel right now will not last forever, even though it feels permanent.

### Safety Planning

**Right now, in this moment:**

1. **Remove means** - Pills, weapons, anything you could use. Give to someone, throw away, lock up, leave the house.
2. **Call someone** - Crisis line, friend, family, therapist
3. **Promise yourself 24 hours** - Don't make permanent decisions in temporary pain. Can you wait 24 hours? Then reassess.
4. **Go somewhere safe** - ER, friend's house, public place

**Make a crisis safety plan** (when you're NOT in crisis):
- Warning signs (thoughts, feelings, situations that precede crisis)
- Internal coping strategies (grounding, distraction)
- People to contact (friends, family, therapist)
- Crisis lines to call
- Professionals/agencies to contact
- Making environment safe (removing means)

**Template:** [988lifeline.org](https://988lifeline.org) (search for "safety plan" or ask when you call)

## Going to the ER for Mental Health Crisis

### When to Go

- You're actively suicidal with a plan
- You've harmed yourself
- You're experiencing psychosis (hallucinations, delusions)
- You can't keep yourself safe

### What to Expect

**Good to know:**
- ERs can help with psychiatric crises, not just physical ones
- You'll be assessed by a mental health professional
- They'll determine if you need:
  - Crisis intervention and release
  - Short-term hospitalization
  - Connection to outpatient resources

**What to bring** (if possible):
- ID, insurance card
- List of medications
- Phone charger
- Trusted person for support

**Your rights:**
- You can usually leave unless you're an immediate danger to yourself/others
- You have the right to refuse treatment (with exceptions for imminent danger)
- You can have someone with you (usually)

### Hospitalization

**If you're hospitalized:**
- Typical stay: 3-7 days
- Focus: Stabilization, safety, medication adjustment, discharge plan
- You'll work with psychiatrist, nurses, social worker

**Know:** Hospitalization is about safety and stabilization, not punishment.

## After the Crisis Passes

### You Survived. Now What?

**First: Be gentle with yourself.**

Crisis takes enormous energy. You might feel:
- Exhausted
- Embarrassed
- Numb
- Confused
- Shaky

**All of this is normal.**

### Follow-Up

1. **Connect with ongoing support**
   - Therapist
   - Psychiatrist (if medication might help)
   - Support group
   - Crisis follow-up services

2. **Update your safety plan**
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - What warning signs did you notice?

3. **Tell someone you trust**
   - You don't have to go through this alone
   - [Mutual Aid Resources](../part2/mutual-aid-in-action.md)

4. **Address root causes**
   - Crisis is a symptom
   - What needs to change? (therapy, medication, life situation, boundaries)

### Prevent Future Crises

**Build your support system:**
- Therapist
- Friends who understand
- Crisis lines saved in your phone
- Online communities
- [Mental Health Support Resources](mental-health-support.md)

**Identify your triggers:**
- What situations, thoughts, or feelings precede crisis?
- Can you catch them earlier next time?

**Practice coping skills when you're NOT in crisis:**
- Grounding
- Distraction
- Reaching out
- Self-soothing

## If Someone You Know Is in Crisis

### What to Do

1. **Take it seriously** - Believe them. Don't minimize.
2. **Ask directly** - "Are you thinking about suicide?"
3. **Listen without judgment**
4. **Don't leave them alone** - Stay with them or ensure someone else is
5. **Help them get help** - Call crisis line together, take them to ER
6. **Remove means** - Pills, weapons, anything harmful
7. **Follow up** - Check in after crisis passes

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't say "You have so much to live for" (minimizes their pain)
- ❌ Don't make them promise not to hurt themselves (creates shame if they break it)
- ❌ Don't try to solve all their problems (you can't)
- ❌ Don't leave them alone if they're actively suicidal
- ❌ Don't swear to secrecy if they're in danger

**You are not responsible for keeping them alive.** You can support, but you cannot control another person's choices. Get professional help involved.

- Connection to resources
- Community

### What Multiverse Can't Offer

We won't:
- Be available 24/7
