# One-Page Decision Tree

## Student Behavior Assessment

### Step 1: Safety Check
**Is anyone in immediate danger?**
- YES → Emergency protocol (page X)
- NO → Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Pattern or Incident?
**Is this the first time or part of a pattern?**
- First time → Set boundary, document, observe
- Pattern (3+ times) → Escalate to admin
- Immediate escalation needed → Skip to Step 4

### Step 3: Communication vs. Violation?
**Is this neurodivergent communication style or actual harm?**

**Communication Style (accommodate):**
- Direct/blunt speech
- Info-dumping
- Literal interpretation
- Asking "inappropriate" questions

**Boundary Violation (address):**
- Repeated unwanted contact after being told no
- Harassment, threats, manipulation
- Involving vulnerable people without infrastructure
- Claiming affiliation falsely

### Step 4: Appropriate Response Level

**Level 1: Redirect**
- Gentle clarification
- Offer alternative
- No documentation needed (unless pattern emerges)

**Level 2: Boundary Setting**
- Name the behavior explicitly
- State what works instead
- Document
- One chance to adjust

**Level 3: Escalation**
- Notify admin
- Temporary pause from community
- Clear expectations for return
- Full documentation

**Level 4: Removal**
- Permanent or long-term removal
- Public disaffiliation if needed
- Protect other community members
- Document thoroughly

## Quick Reference Questions

Before you act, ask yourself:
1. Is anyone unsafe right now?
2. Have I set a clear boundary?
3. Is this about neurodivergence or about harm?
4. Have I documented this?
5. Do I need to escalate?

**When in doubt, escalate.**

| Student mentions suicide | Level 4: Emergency protocol |
| Student love-bombs teacher | Level 2: Boundary setting |
