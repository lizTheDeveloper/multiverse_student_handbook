## How Learning Works Here

**No grades. No lectures. No bullshit.**

- You **build things** and share what you discover
- You **ask questions** and help others figure stuff out
- You **experiment** - broken code teaches you just as much as working code
- You **learn at your own pace** - 6 weeks minimum, but take the time you need
- You **contribute to the collective investigation** - everyone's discoveries help everyone learn

**We don't do:**
- Assignments (there are exercises, but you choose what to explore)
- Grades or performance tracking
- Lecturing at you
- Punishment for "not getting it"

**You learn by doing, building, and sharing. That's it.**

## What Makes This Different

This is a **liberatory learning community** - education as the practice of freedom, not compliance.

**What that means:**
- **Horizontal relationships** - Facilitators have expertise, you have questions. Both matter. We learn from each other.
- **Mutual aid** - We help each other because we're interconnected, not because some people are "helpers" and others are "helpless"
- **No saviors or gurus** - No one here is enlightened. We're all figuring it out together.
- **Transparent about power** - Facilitators can enforce agreements and remove harmful people. We're honest about that.
- **Neurodivergent-affirming** - Direct communication, no masking required, accommodations offered

**This works for:** Unconventional learners, neurodivergent people, folks recovering from traditional education trauma, anyone who learns better by building than by listening to lectures.

## Community Agreements

We have a [Code of Conduct](part4/multiverse-code-of-conduct.md) that boils down to:
- Be excellent to each other
- Be kind and helpful
- Learn cool stuff, share cool stuff, build cool stuff
- Ask questions, dig deep
- Don't be a dick (full details in the CoC)

**Confused about terms?** [Common Misunderstandings](part2/common-misunderstandings.md) explains what we mean by "horizontal relationships," "mutual aid," "boundaries," etc.

## Recognizing Unhealthy Patterns

We teach you to recognize manipulation, unhealthy communities, and cult dynamics - because many of us have experienced them.

**Red flags in communities:**
- Leaders demand absolute loyalty or punish questioning
- Isolation from outside friends/family
- Love-bombing followed by withdrawal as control
- Criticism of leaders is forbidden

**Red flags in individuals:**
- Positions themselves as your only source of support
- Creates urgency/crisis to demand attention
- Weaponizes struggles to manipulate you
- Violates boundaries then claims discrimination

**Full guides:**
- [Healthy vs. Unhealthy Communities](part1/healthy-vs-unhealthy-communities.md)
- [Understanding Manipulation](part1/understanding-manipulation.md)
- [Recognizing Unhealthy Dependency](part2/recognizing-dependency.md)
