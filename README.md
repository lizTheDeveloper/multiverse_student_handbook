# The Multiverse School: Student Handbook

**Your Guide to Building, Learning, and Thriving in Community**

---

## ⚠️ CRISIS CONTEXT (November 2025)

**If you're LGBTQ+, a targeted minority, or in danger:**

We're in the middle of a fascist takeover of the United States. The government is shutting down services. Lists are being made. People are disappearing.

**GTFO Meeting - Fridays at 5pm (FREE)**
- **Sign up:** [luma.com/MultiverseSchool](https://luma.com/MultiverseSchool)
- Working on visas, emigration, getting out
- We recommend LGBTQ+ folks and other targeted minorities leave the US
- This is about survival, not learning to code

**📍 [Emigration Resources: How to Leave →](part7/emigration-resources.md)**

**Your safety comes first. Learning can wait. We're online - you can take classes from anywhere in the world. Leave if you need to.**

## Core Principles

### 1. Education Is the Practice of Freedom
Learning happens through building, experimenting, and investigating together—not through lectures or grades.

### 2. Mutual Aid, Not Charity
We help each other because we're interconnected. You can ask for help. People can say yes or no. Both need to consent. **[Full explanation →](part2/common-misunderstandings.md#mutual-aid-doesnt-mean-you-owe-me-what-i-need)**

### 3. Boundaries Are Acts of Love
When someone sets a boundary, they're protecting the relationship—not rejecting you. You're allowed boundaries. Others are allowed boundaries. Both are necessary. **[Full explanation →](part2/student-boundaries.md)**

### 4. No Saviors, No Gurus
No one here is your rescuer or enlightened guru. We're all people building and learning together.

### 5. Horizontal Relationships, Not Hierarchy
Everyone's humanity is equal. Power differences are transparent. Facilitators have authority to enforce agreements and remove harmful people—that's part of maintaining safe community. **[Full explanation →](part2/common-misunderstandings.md#horizontal-relationships-doesnt-mean-no-authority)**

## Red Flags to Watch For

### In Communities:
- Leaders demand absolute loyalty or punish questioning
- Isolation from friends/family outside the community
- "Us vs. them" mentality
- Expected to work for free indefinitely
- Criticism forbidden
- Love-bombing followed by withdrawal as control

**[Full guide →](part1/healthy-vs-unhealthy-communities.md)**

### In Individuals:
- Positions themselves as your only source of support
- "No one else understands you like I do"
- Creates urgency/crisis to demand attention
- Weaponizes struggles ("if you don't help me, I'll hurt myself")
- Violates boundaries then claims discrimination
