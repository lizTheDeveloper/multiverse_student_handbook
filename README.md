## How Learning Works Here

**No grades. No bullshit. Learning by doing.**

**Becoming an engineer means doing lots of little projects.** You decide you want to build something, then sit down and chip away at it. That's it.

**Here's how it works:**
- **Start projects in class** - We give you several projects to get started with together
- **Use [Interactive AI Tutors](https://publish.obsidian.md/multiversecurriculum/Curriculum/Interactive+Tutors/1+-+Start+Here) to rapidly prototype** - The tutors help you understand what you're building as you build it
- **There are scaffolding exercises** for any tools or code you need to learn - the [AI tutors](https://publish.obsidian.md/multiversecurriculum/Curriculum/Interactive+Tutors/1+-+Start+Here) walk you through them
- **Come to class to motivate each other, connect as humans, and get questions answered** - That's what class time is for
- **Share what you discover** - Everyone's experiments help everyone learn

**We use flipped classroom:**
- Watch videos, lectures, and other passive learning on your own time at your own pace
- The curriculum has videos on most pages - watch them before class
- Come to class ready to do the exercises from the videos and ask questions
- Try to start the exercises before class if you can
- Use [Interactive AI Tutors](https://publish.obsidian.md/multiversecurriculum/Curriculum/Interactive+Tutors/1+-+Start+Here) to help you understand the code as you work through exercises
- Class time is for tech demos, working together, getting unstuck, and human connection
- We do tech demos (these can take a while, but they're hands-on and interactive)
- You always have time in class to work on your projects

**We don't do:**
- Traditional lectures where you sit and take notes
- Assignments with deadlines (there are exercises, but you choose what to explore)
- Grades or performance tracking
- Punishment for "not getting it"

**You learn by building lots of little projects with AI tutor support. Class is for starting together, staying motivated, and connecting as humans.**

### What Makes This Different

This is a **liberatory learning community** - education as the practice of freedom, not compliance.

**What that means:**
- **Horizontal relationships** - Facilitators have expertise, you have questions. Both matter. We learn from each other.
- **Mutual aid** - We help each other because we're interconnected, not because some people are "helpers" and others are "helpless"
- **No saviors or gurus** - No one here is enlightened. We're all figuring it out together.
- **Transparent about power** - Facilitators can enforce agreements and remove harmful people. We're honest about that.
- **Neurodivergent-affirming** - Direct communication, no masking required, accommodations offered

**This works for:** Unconventional learners, neurodivergent people, folks recovering from traditional education trauma, anyone who learns better by building than by listening to lectures.

**Read more:** [Liberatory Pedagogy Framework](LIBERATORY_FRAMEWORK.md)

### Community Agreements

We have a [Code of Conduct](part4/multiverse-code-of-conduct.md) that boils down to:
- Be excellent to each other
- Be kind and helpful
- Learn cool stuff, share cool stuff, build cool stuff
- Ask questions, dig deep
- Don't be a dick (full details in the CoC)

**Confused about terms?** [Common Misunderstandings](part2/common-misunderstandings.md) explains what we mean by "horizontal relationships," "mutual aid," "boundaries," etc.
