## Core Principles: What We Believe

### 1. Education Is the Practice of Freedom
Learning isn't about memorizing what someone tells you. It's about investigating the world, asking questions, building things, and figuring out how reality works—together.

**What this means for you:** No one's going to lecture at you. You build, you experiment, you share what you discover. That's how learning happens here.

### 2. Mutual Aid, Not Charity
We help each other because we're interconnected, not because some people are "helpers" and others are "helpless."

**What this means for you:** You give what you can. You receive what you need. Sometimes you give more. Sometimes you receive more. The circle flows.

### 3. Boundaries Are Acts of Love
When someone sets a boundary with you, they're protecting the relationship and the community—not rejecting you.

**What this means for you:** You're allowed to have boundaries. Others are allowed to have boundaries. Both are necessary for sustainable community.

### 4. No Saviors, No Gurus
No one here is your rescuer. No one here is enlightened. We're all just people trying to build and learn together.

**What this means for you:** If someone positions themselves as your savior or as uniquely wise, that's a red flag. If you find yourself depending on one person for all your support, that's a pattern to notice.

### 5. Horizontal Relationships, Not Hierarchy
Facilitators have experience and expertise in specific areas. You have lived experience and questions. Both matter. We learn from each other.

**What this means for you:** You're not "just a student." You're a co-learner. Your questions matter. Your experiments matter. What you build matters.

## How The Multiverse School Actually Works

### Getting Started (Your First Steps)

**1. Sign up on your dashboard**
- Add your contact info and social media links so Liz can follow you and stay connected
- This is how you become part of the community

**2. Introduce yourself in Matrix (our chat platform)**
- This is like making friends - just say hi, share what you're interested in learning
- No need for anything fancy, just be yourself

**3. Start learning with the [Interactive Tutor Curriculum](https://publish.obsidian.md/multiversecurriculum/Curriculum/Interactive+Tutors/1+-+Start+Here)**
- Free, self-paced, designed for unconventional learners
- Work through it at your own speed

**4. Come to the "Learn to Code" stand-up (9am on campus)**
- This is your daily office hours - bring questions from the interactive tutors
- Share what you're working on, get unstuck, support each other
- Plan to spend **at least 6 weeks** working through the curriculum

**5. After 6+ weeks of learning → switch to "Job Search" stand-up**
- Don't try to job search while you're still learning
- You need at least 6 weeks actually doing the Learn to Code assignments first
- Only switch to "Job Search" stand-up when you're ready to actively look for work
- The "Job Search" stand-up is for people who have completed the curriculum

**6. Want to learn more after the basics? Take specialized classes**
- **Sign up for a membership** - gets you curriculum access to specialized topics
- **Sign up for a class** - structured learning on specific subjects
- Check [themultiverse.school](https://themultiverse.school) for up-to-date class listings

### We Don't Do Assignments
There are **exercises** you can explore. You can do them or not. The consequence of not doing them is: you don't get the learning that comes from doing them. That's it.

### We Don't Do Grades
There's no completion tracking, no performance metrics, no "passing" or "failing."

**How do you know if you're learning?** You build things. You see what works and what doesn't. You get better at building.

### Recognition Comes from Contribution
Want recognition from the community? **Share what you build in chat.** Working or broken—doesn't matter. Share your experiments, your questions, your discoveries.

That's how you get seen here: by contributing to the collective investigation.

### Natural Consequences, Not Punishment
If you don't participate, you don't learn. If you don't contribute to the community, you don't get community recognition. If you harm the community repeatedly, you can't stay.

These aren't punishments—they're natural consequences of how community works.

---

## When to Be Concerned

### Red Flags in Communities

**You should be concerned if:**
- Leaders demand absolute loyalty or punish questioning
- You're isolated from friends/family outside the community
- There's an "us vs. them" mentality (the community vs. the evil outside world)
- You're expected to work for free indefinitely
- Criticism of leaders is forbidden
- You're told you're "special" or "chosen"
- There's love-bombing followed by withdrawal of affection as control
- Your consent is ignored or coerced
- You're shamed for having boundaries

**This is NOT normal.** See [Healthy vs. Unhealthy Communities](part1/healthy-vs-unhealthy-communities.md) for more.

### Red Flags in Individuals

**Be cautious if someone:**
- Positions themselves as your only source of support
- Says things like "no one else understands you like I do"
- Creates urgency or crisis to demand your attention
- Uses their struggles to manipulate you ("if you don't help me, I'll hurt myself")
- Violates boundaries and then claims discrimination when called out
- Recruits you for their "vision" before demonstrating groundedness

**These are manipulation patterns.** See [Understanding Manipulation](part1/understanding-manipulation.md) for more.

## What to Do If You're Struggling

### If You're in Crisis
1. **Call 988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
2. See [Crisis Resources](crisis_resource_appendix.md) for more options
3. Let a facilitator know if you feel safe doing so (they can't fix it, but they can connect you to resources)

### If You're Overwhelmed
1. Take a break. Seriously. The community will be here when you're ready.
2. Reduce expectations—you don't have to build anything right now
3. Stay connected to chat if it feels supportive; take a break from chat if it doesn't
4. Get support outside of Multiverse (therapy, friends, crisis lines)

### If Someone Is Hurting You
1. Name the behavior specifically ("When you said X, I felt Y")
2. Set a boundary ("I need you to stop doing X")
3. If they don't respect it, talk to a facilitator
4. Document what's happening (screenshots, notes, dates)

### If You Think You've Been in a Cult
You're not alone. Many people have. See [Cult Recovery Resources](part1/cult-recovery-resources.md) for support.
