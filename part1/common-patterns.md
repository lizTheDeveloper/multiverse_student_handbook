# Common Patterns: Recognizing When Someone Needs Different Support

## For Everyone in the Community

The Multiverse School attracts brilliant, unconventional people with rich inner lives and complex experiences. Most people navigate learning community successfully. Some people arrive when they need healing resources we can't provide, or engage in behaviors that harm collective wellbeing.

**From a healing-centered perspective, we ask:** "What happened to you? What healing do you need?" **From a relational accountability perspective, we also ask:** "Can you participate in voluntary cooperation? Are your current behaviors compatible with collective safety?"

This section helps you recognize patterns—**in yourself or others**—that signal someone may need different support, or behaviors that require clear boundaries to protect the community.

## Pattern 1: Grandiose Vision Without Grounding

### What It Looks Like
- Talks about being uniquely positioned to save, heal, or transform others
- Describes a "calling" or "mission" that requires immediate action and followers
- Recruits others into their project or tries to form a "movement" within Multiverse
- Positions themselves as holding special knowledge or insight that bypasses feedback
- Resists skill-building or preparation by claiming urgency or divine timing

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone is:
- Experiencing spiritual emergence or crisis
- In a heightened energy state that needs grounding
- Using big visions to avoid their own healing work (spiritual bypassing)
- Genuinely passionate but lacking capacity for grounded implementation

**Note:** We don't diagnose. We recognize when someone's current state is incompatible with safe community participation.

### How to Respond
- Redirect to the **[90-Day Visionary Pause Policy](../90_day_visionary_pause_policy.md)**
- Acknowledge their passion while insisting on grounded preparation
- Do not argue about the validity of their vision—focus on process and readiness
- Monitor for recruitment behavior that involves vulnerable people
- Document and escalate if they bypass agreements

**Boundary:** If they begin involving unhoused, mentally distressed, or otherwise vulnerable people in their project without infrastructure or oversight, intervene immediately for everyone's safety.

## Pattern 2: Rapid Relational Intensity

### What It Looks Like
- Shares heavy personal content in public channels without consent-seeking
- Seeks deep emotional connection with facilitators or peers very quickly
- Sends many private messages, sometimes at unusual hours
- Uses language suggesting familial closeness ("soul family," "finally found my people")
- Experiences distress when relational boundaries are clarified
- May interpret boundaries as rejection or discrimination

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone:
- Is experiencing intense loneliness and seeking connection
- Has attachment wounds that affect how they form relationships
- Hasn't yet developed support systems beyond the school
- Is confusing intellectual resonance with emotional intimacy
- Needs therapeutic support for processing trauma

### How to Respond
- Set clear, compassionate boundaries early: *"I care about your wellbeing, and I'm your facilitator, not your therapist. Here are resources for the support you're describing."*
- Redirect personal disclosures to appropriate contexts (therapy, crisis support, consent-based sharing)
- Acknowledge their feelings while maintaining relational clarity
- Document patterns of boundary-testing
- Offer clear reminders; escalate if behavior persists or intensifies

**Boundary:** If someone engages in stalking behavior, threatens self-harm when boundaries are set, or love-bombs staff in ways that create obligation, this requires immediate community pause for everyone's safety.

## Pattern 3: Recurring Crisis and Instability

### What It Looks Like
- Frequent urgent situations shared in learning spaces (housing instability, relationship crises, health emergencies)
- Crisis cycles that repeat weekly or bi-weekly
- Difficulty engaging with solutions or support resources when offered
- Learning commitments disrupted by ongoing emergencies
- May intensify crisis sharing when not receiving expected responses

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone:
- Is living in genuine material precarity or chronic crisis
- Has learned that crisis is how connection happens
- Needs stabilization support before community learning is sustainable
- Would benefit from intensive case management or crisis services
- Is experiencing emotional dysregulation that requires therapeutic support

**Note:** Crisis is real. And sometimes people are experiencing conditions that require different support than a learning community can provide.

### How to Respond
- Offer compassionate witnessing: *"I see you're going through a lot. Here are crisis resources."*
- Connect to appropriate support (988, mutual aid networks, case management) rather than solving problems yourself
- Maintain consistent expectations for learning engagement
- Document frequency and impact on learning community
- Set clear boundaries: *"I care about your wellbeing. The support you need right now is beyond what I can provide as a facilitator. Here are resources designed for crisis support."*

**Boundary:** If crisis sharing is repeatedly used to avoid accountability, manipulate responses, or derail collective learning, a community pause may be needed while the person accesses appropriate crisis support.

## Pattern 4: Dominating or Condescending Communication

### What It Looks Like
- Frequently corrects others publicly, often in condescending ways
- Dominates discussions; difficult for others to contribute
- Questions facilitators' expertise or methods in ways that undermine trust
- "Well, actually" pattern that derails conversations
- Frames hurtful communication as "just being logical" or "telling the truth"
- May dismiss others' contributions or talk over peers

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone:
- Is communicating in autistic or neurodivergent styles that may be misinterpreted (direct, literal, correction-focused)
- Has weaponized intelligence as a defense mechanism
- Hasn't yet learned impact vs. intent
- Needs support distinguishing between healthy debate and harm
- Has experienced being dismissed and is overcorrecting

**Important distinction:** Autistic directness is not the same as condescension. We support neurodivergent communication AND we address harm when communication undermines collective safety.

### How to Respond
- Name the impact directly: *"That tone is having a harmful impact on collaborative learning. Can we try a different approach?"*
- Distinguish neurodivergent communication style from condescension or dominance
- Redirect to async channels if someone monopolizes synchronous space
- Privately discuss impact vs. intent
- Offer one clear opportunity to adjust; document and escalate if pattern persists

**Boundary:** If communication is belittling, gaslighting, or making others feel unsafe to participate, intervene to protect collective learning space.

## Pattern 5: Vision Before Foundation

### What It Looks Like
- Wants to teach, lead, or build a school/project within weeks of joining
- Has expansive vision but hasn't yet developed plan, resources, or safety infrastructure
- Recruits community members into their projects
- Positions themselves as ready to lead despite being new to the community
- May form parallel communities or groups that compete with Multiverse

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone:
- Is experiencing heightened energy or urgency
- Is using visionary work to bypass their own healing or skill-building
- Has genuine passion but hasn't yet built capacity for sustainable leadership
- Needs support grounding big ideas into actionable steps

### How to Respond
- Immediately offer **[The Grounded Visionary Path](../90_day_visionary_pause_policy.md)** (90-day skill-building program)
- Frame as supportive preparation, not restriction: *"Your vision deserves a strong foundation. Here's how we support visionaries in building capacity."*
- Clarify that recruiting community members or representing Multiverse requires going through this process
- Monitor for willingness to engage in grounded preparation
- Document and escalate if they bypass the process

**Boundary:** If someone launches their project anyway, publicly recruiting community members or claiming Multiverse affiliation, we disaffiliate them clearly to protect everyone involved.

## Pattern 6: Avoiding Accountability Through Harm Claims

### What It Looks Like
- Frames every boundary or feedback as persecution or discrimination
- Uses identity, diagnosis, or trauma to deflect accountability
- Recruits others to validate their narrative ("Can you believe what they did to me?")
- Alternates between expressing vulnerability and making aggressive demands
- Reframes relational accountability as oppression

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone:
- Has experienced real marginalization or ableism and is hypervigilant
- Hasn't yet learned to distinguish harm from boundaries
- Is using trauma or identity instrumentally to avoid consequences
- Needs support developing capacity for mutual accountability

**Important:** Real harm and discrimination happen. AND sometimes people weaponize harm language to avoid accountability. Both are true.

### How to Respond
- Acknowledge feelings while maintaining clarity: *"I hear that you're upset. Here's what happened from my perspective."*
- Document all interactions thoroughly
- Don't argue or over-explain—state facts once, then maintain boundaries
- Protect community members from being recruited into adversarial narratives
- Distinguish between someone processing real harm vs. weaponizing harm language
- Escalate to admin when pattern is clear

**Boundary:** If someone repeatedly weaponizes identity, trauma, or harm language to avoid relational accountability or to harm others, community participation may need to pause while they develop capacity for mutual accountability.

## Pattern 7: Intense Distrust or Perceived Persecution

### What It Looks Like
- Expresses belief they are being targeted, surveilled, hacked, or conspired against
- Makes accusations against staff or community members without substantiation
- May involve outside authorities (police, lawyers) in ways that escalate situations
- Shares serious allegations publicly before discussing privately
- Intensifies when their perception is questioned or not validated

### What This May Signal
This pattern can emerge when someone:
- Is experiencing psychosis, extreme paranoia, or delusional thinking
- Has PTSD or hypervigilance from real past targeting
- Is in active substance use that affects perception
- Has experienced genuine stalking or targeting (this does happen—always investigate carefully)

**Important:** Real stalking and targeting happen, especially to marginalized people. We take all reports seriously AND we recognize when someone's perception may be affected by mental health crisis.

### How to Respond
- Don't argue with their experience or try to convince them otherwise
- Use grounding, supportive language: *"That sounds really frightening. Are you safe right now? Do you have support?"*
- Offer crisis resources (988, local crisis teams)
- Assess whether community participation is safe for them right now
- Escalate to admin immediately
- Document everything thoroughly
- If allegations involve staff, follow standard investigation protocols

**Boundary:** If someone makes threats, involves police in ways that endanger others, or makes serious unsubstantiated accusations against staff/members, immediate community pause is necessary for everyone's safety. Full documentation is essential.

## How to Use This Guide

### If You're Recognizing These Patterns in Yourself:

1. **Self-awareness is strength**
   - Recognizing you might need different support is courageous
   - These patterns make sense given what you've experienced
   - Getting appropriate help isn't failure—it's self-care

2. **Ask yourself:**
   - Do I have professional support (therapist, psychiatrist)?
   - Am I in crisis more often than I'm grounded?
   - Am I able to participate in voluntary cooperation?
   - Do I need stabilization before community learning?

3. **What to do:**
   - Talk to a facilitator honestly
   - Connect with therapy or crisis resources
   - Take a break if you need it
   - Come back when you're ready

### If You're Recognizing These Patterns in Someone Else:

1. **Look for patterns, not single moments**
   - One difficult day is not a pattern
   - Three similar incidents suggest someone may need different support
   - Ongoing cycles indicate someone needs resources we may not be able to provide

2. **Document if needed**
   - If you're experiencing harm: dates, screenshots, what happened
   - Documentation protects everyone

3. **Talk to a facilitator**
   - You don't need to be certain to ask for support
   - Your sense that something is off is valuable information
   - Don't try to manage patterns alone

4. **Honor your boundaries**
   - If someone's behavior makes you feel unsafe, manipulated, or depleted—that's real data
   - You're allowed (and encouraged) to protect yourself
   - Self-care enables continued care for community

## Key Takeaway

We are designed to support brilliant, unconventional minds and honor different ways of being. We are not equipped to provide crisis intervention, intensive mental health support, or containment for behaviors that harm collective safety.

**From liberatory pedagogy:** "No one liberates themselves alone; we liberate ourselves together or not at all." (Paulo Freire)

When someone's current state makes voluntary cooperation impossible, or when behaviors repeatedly harm collective wellbeing, we practice relational accountability: we name what's happening, offer appropriate resources, and sometimes require community pause so everyone can get the support they need.

> **Remember:** You can hold deep compassion for someone's pain while maintaining fierce boundaries about behavior that harms others. Both are acts of love. Both are necessary.
