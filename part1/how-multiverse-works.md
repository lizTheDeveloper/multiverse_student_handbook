# How The Multiverse School Works

## What This Space Is

The Multiverse School is a **building community for unconventional learners.** We practice liberatory education—learning as the practice of freedom, not compliance.

**What we're NOT:**
- A traditional online course with lectures and grades
- A bootcamp with a fixed curriculum
- A therapy group or crisis intervention service
- A place where you passively consume content

**What we ARE:**
- A community of people building things together
- A space for investigating through experimentation
- Horizontal learning (everyone teaches and everyone learns)
- Mutual aid (we help each other)
- Grounded in [liberatory pedagogy](../LIBERATORY_FRAMEWORK.md)

---

## The Core Principles

### 1. Problem-Posing, Not Banking Model (Paulo Freire)

**Banking model** = Teacher deposits knowledge into passive students (you memorize, regurgitate, comply)

**Problem-posing** = We investigate reality together through questions and experiments

**What this means:**
- Facilitators don't lecture at you
- We pose problems: "How does this work? Let's investigate"
- You build, experiment, discover
- Everyone contributes to the investigation

**Example:**
- ❌ "Here's how to build authentication. Memorize these steps."
- ✅ "Let's explore authentication. What approaches exist? Try one. What breaks? Why? What did you learn?"

---

### 2. Mutual Aid, Not Charity (Emma Goldman)

**Mutual aid** = We help each other because we're interconnected

**Charity** = Some people "help" others (hierarchy, dependence)

**What this means:**
- You give what you can
- You receive what you need
- Sometimes you give more; sometimes you receive more
- The circle flows
- No one is "just a helper" or "just helped"

**Example:**
- You're stuck on a bug → someone helps you debug
- Later, they're stuck → you share a resource you found
- Someone else posts what they built → you learn from it
- You post what you built → others learn from you

---

### 3. Voluntary Participation, Not Coercion

**Everything here is voluntary:**
- No required assignments
- No grades or completion tracking
- No compliance expectations
- You choose your own engagement level

**Natural consequences exist:**
- Don't build → don't learn
- Don't share → don't get community recognition
- Harm the community repeatedly → can't stay
- These aren't punishments—they're how community works

---

### 4. Recognition Through Contribution

**How you get seen here:**
- Share what you build in chat (working or broken!)
- Answer someone's question
- Share a resource you found
- Help someone debug
- Post your experiments

**You don't get recognized for:**
- Lurking silently
- Consuming without contributing
- Taking without giving

**This isn't meritocracy** (the "best" don't rise). It's **contribution**—the people who share, help, and build together get community recognition.

---

### 5. Horizontal Relationships, Not Hierarchy

**Facilitators have:**
- Experience in specific areas (web dev, AI, community building)
- Skills to share
- Responsibility for facilitation

**You have:**
- Lived experience
- Questions that drive investigation
- Skills to share (even if you don't know it yet)

**Both matter equally.** Facilitators aren't gurus. You're not "just a student." We're co-learners.

**Power exists** (Liz founded this, facilitators make decisions), but we try to make it transparent, not pretend it doesn't exist.

---

## How Learning Actually Happens Here

### The Cycle

**1. A problem or question emerges**
- "How do I build X?"
- "Why does Y work this way?"
- "What's the best approach for Z?"

**2. You investigate**
- Try something
- See what happens
- Share what you discover (in chat, show-and-tell, etc.)

**3. Community responds**
- Others share what they tried
- Someone debugs with you
- Resources get shared
- Questions get asked

**4. Understanding deepens**
- Not from being told, but from building
- Not from one answer, but from collective investigation

**5. You apply it to the next thing**
- And the cycle continues

---

## What Exercises Are (And Aren't)

### Exercises Are:
- **Invitations to investigate**
- "Here's a problem space. Explore it. See what you discover."
- Optional starting points
- Prompts for building

### Exercises Are NOT:
- Required assignments
- Graded work
- Tests of your worth
- Things you "should" complete

**You can:**
- Do them
- Modify them
- Ignore them
- Create your own

**The learning is in the doing**, not the completing.

---

## How to Participate

### Minimum Viable Participation
- Show up to chat/sessions if you want
- Try building things when it interests you
- Ask questions when you're stuck

**That's it.** That's enough.

### Active Participation (More Recognition)
- Share what you build (broken or working)
- Help others when you know something
- Post resources you find useful
- Contribute to collective investigation
- Show up to community events

### What Doesn't Work Here
- Expecting to be taught (banking model)
- Taking without giving (extraction)
- Demanding immediate answers (we investigate together)
- Lurking indefinitely without engaging

**You choose your level.** Just know: contribution = community.

---

## Facilitator Role

### What Facilitators Do:
- Pose problems for investigation
- Provide resources and guidance
- Help you when you're stuck
- Model building and learning
- Hold space for the community
- Set boundaries when needed

### What Facilitators Don't Do:
- Give you all the answers
- Grade your work
- Manage your learning
- Rescue you
- Operate on your timeline

**Facilitators have boundaries:**
- Office hours (usually stated)
- Response time (24-48 hours for messages)
- Scope (they can help with X, refer you elsewhere for Y)

**This isn't coldness—it's sustainability.**

---

## Community Agreements (Code of Conduct)

We have a [Code of Conduct](../part4/multiverse-code-of-conduct.md) that we co-created.

**Core agreements:**
- Respect people's boundaries
- Don't harm the collective (harassment, bigotry, manipulation)
- Participate in mutual aid (give and receive)
- Own your impact (when you cause harm, be accountable)
- Engage consensually (this is voluntary cooperation)

**If you violate agreements:**
- First: conversation (what happened, can you participate differently?)
- Then: pause or removal if you can't participate consensually

**Removal isn't punishment**—it's recognizing you can't be in voluntary relationship with the community right now.

---

## What "Building" Means

### Projects You Might Build:
- Web apps (to-do lists, portfolio sites, APIs)
- AI tools (chatbots, automation, experiments)
- Documentation (explainers, guides, notes)
- Art/creative work (if that's your thing)
- Tools for your own use
- Contributions to open source

### The Point Isn't the Product
The point is:
- **Investigating** how things work
- **Experimenting** with approaches
- **Discovering** what breaks and why
- **Sharing** what you learn

**A broken project you share teaches more than a perfect project you hide.**

---

## Recognition & "Success"

### How You Know You're Learning:
- You build things
- They work (or you understand why they don't)
- You get better at building
- You help others build
- You ask better questions

**Not:**
- Grades
- Certificates
- External validation
- Completion metrics

### How the Community Recognizes You:
- People respond to what you share
- Others build on your ideas
- You're invited to collaborate
- Facilitators notice your contributions

**This is emergent**, not awarded.

---

## Money & Access

### What You Pay For:
- Access to the community
- Facilitator availability (office hours, feedback)
- Infrastructure (chat, hosting, tools)
- Curriculum frameworks and exercises

### What You Don't Pay For:
- Grades or evaluation
- Guaranteed outcomes
- Individual tutoring beyond stated hours
- Rescue or crisis intervention

**Prices are stated upfront.** No hidden escalation. If you can't afford it, talk to Liz—sliding scale exists.

**No shame around money.** This is mutual aid, not extraction.

---

## Boundaries Are Necessary

### Common Boundaries You'll Encounter:

**Facilitator boundaries:**
- Office hours (they're not available 24/7)
- Response time (don't expect instant answers)
- Scope (they can help with X, not Y)

**Community boundaries:**
- No harassment, bigotry, manipulation
- No recruiting for your projects without completing the 90-Day Grounded Visionary Track
- No dumping crisis in community spaces (use crisis resources, talk to facilitators privately)

**Your boundaries:**
- You can say "no" to anything
- You can leave anytime
- You can participate less or more
- You can protect your time/energy

**Boundaries aren't rejection—they're how we sustain community.**

---

## Crisis & Mental Health

### What We Offer:
- [Crisis resources](../crisis_resource_appendix.md) (hotlines, services)
- Compassionate referral to professional help
- Community support (not therapy)
- Space to be neurodivergent without pathologizing

### What We Don't Offer:
- Therapy or crisis intervention
- 24/7 emotional support
- Treatment for mental health conditions
- Rescue from crisis

**If you're in crisis:**
1. Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
2. Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
3. See [Crisis Resources](../crisis_resource_appendix.md)
4. Let a facilitator know if you want (they'll connect you to resources)

**We care about you AND we're not equipped for crisis intervention.**

---

## If This Isn't Right for You

**This space works well if you:**
- Want to build things and investigate
- Can tolerate uncertainty ("let's figure it out together")
- Value horizontal relationships over hierarchy
- Want community, not just content
- Can participate in mutual aid (give and receive)

**This space might not work if you:**
- Want a traditional course with lectures and grades
- Need constant validation or immediate answers
- Expect to be taught without building
- Want a therapist or crisis support (get that elsewhere, then come here)
- Can't respect boundaries or participate consensually

**Both are okay.** Different people need different learning environments.

## Questions?

### "Do I have to participate in everything?"
No. Participate at whatever level works for you.

### "What if I don't build anything?"
Then you don't learn through building. That's the natural consequence. No punishment, just... no building-based learning.

### "Can I just lurk?"
For a while, sure. Eventually, if you're not contributing, you're extracting. Mutual aid requires give and receive.

### "What if I mess up?"
Share it anyway. We learn from what breaks.

### "Can I leave?"
Anytime. No shame. Come back if it feels right.

### "What if a facilitator sets a boundary I don't like?"
You can disagree. You can talk about it. You can leave. What you can't do is ignore it.

### "Is this a cult?"
See: [Healthy vs. Unhealthy Communities](healthy-vs-unhealthy-communities.md)

Transparently: We have strong opinions about education. We set boundaries. We're small and relationships can feel intense. Liz has founder power.

**AND:** You can leave anytime. We encourage outside relationships. We don't punish questioning. We refer you to professional support. We're transparent about power.

**If we're not holding those commitments, tell us.**

---

## Welcome

You're here. You belong here (as long as you can participate consensually).

Build things. Break things. Share what you discover. Help others. Ask questions. Investigate reality together.

**That's how we learn.**
