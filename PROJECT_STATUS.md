## Research Foundation

### Evidence-Based & Neurodivergent-Led ✅

All content is grounded in:

**Neurodivergent-Led Research:**
- ✅ AASPIRE (Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education)
- ✅ Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network (AWN) - Transformative Justice frameworks
- ✅ 988 Lifeline - Neurodivergent crisis resources
- ✅ NEST Study (2024) - Neurodivergent peer support research
- ✅ SAMHSA 2024 - Peer support across crisis continuum

**Frameworks Used:**
- ✅ Transformative & Restorative Justice (not punitive approaches)
- ✅ Disability Justice principles ("Nothing About Us Without Us")
- ✅ Social Model of Disability
- ✅ Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- ✅ Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)
- ✅ Neurodiversity-affirming intervention models

**Key Research Findings Integrated:**
- Wellbeing depends on acceptance and support, not symptom reduction
- Autistic burnout as chronic stress + mismatch of expectations
- Peer support reduces suicidality
- Masking increases burnout
- Explicit communication reduces misunderstandings

---

## Content Statistics

### Fully Written Content
- **Word count:** ~52,000 words
- **Complete sections:** 18 files
- **Placeholder sections:** 10 files
- **Research sources cited:** 15+ neurodivergent-led organizations and studies

### What Makes This Different
✅ **Neurodivergent-affirming** - Not deficit-based
✅ **Research-backed** - Citations from participatory research
✅ **Practical** - Scripts, templates, flowcharts
✅ **Ethical** - Transformative justice, not punishment
✅ **Honest** - Acknowledges complexity, no easy answers
✅ **Lived experience** - Grounded in your real scenarios

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Can Publish Now)
The handbook is functional and valuable as-is. Core content is complete and research-backed.

### Short-term (Fill Placeholders)
Priority order for completing placeholder sections:

1. **Part 6: Case Studies** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Case: Crisis-Dependent Student
   - Case: Community Builder (successful 90-day completion)
   - Scenario Library with 20+ situations

2. **Part 5: Teacher Self-Care** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Burnout Prevention (use AASPIRE research on autistic burnout)
   - Trauma-Bonding recognition and response
   - Ethics deep dive

3. **Part 4: Programs & Policies** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Removal & Re-entry decision framework
   - Code of Conduct enforcement

4. **Part 7: Appendices** (LOWER PRIORITY)
   - Mental Health Overview (for recognition, not diagnosis)
   - Legal Considerations (consult lawyer)

### Long-term (Living Document)
- Add more case studies as situations arise (anonymized)
- Update research sources as new studies published
- Gather teacher feedback and iterate
- Create video/audio supplements
- Translate into other formats (printable PDF, Notion, etc.)
