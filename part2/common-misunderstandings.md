# Common Misunderstandings (And What We Actually Mean)

This page clarifies terms that are sometimes misunderstood or weaponized.

**For genuinely confused people:** These definitions help you understand what we mean.

**For facilitators:** Link here when you see confusion or weaponization.

## "Horizontal Relationships" Doesn't Mean "No Authority"

### What it means:
- Everyone's humanity is equal
- Power differences are transparent, not hidden
- Students can question, give feedback, set boundaries with facilitators
- Learning flows in multiple directions
- No one is inherently "better" than anyone else

### What it does NOT mean:
- Facilitators can't enforce community agreements
- No one has authority to remove harmful people
- Everyone gets to do whatever they want
- There are no consequences for violating agreements

**Facilitators have specific authority to:**
- Enforce Code of Conduct
- Remove people who repeatedly harm the community
- Set boundaries on their own time/availability
- Make final decisions about community safety

**Being transparent about power:** Facilitators have removal authority. That's part of maintaining safe community. "Horizontal" doesn't mean "no structure" - it means "honest about structure."

## "Mutual Aid" Doesn't Mean "You Owe Me What I Need"

### What it means:
- People offer what they can, not what you demand
- You can ask, not require
- Both parties consent to the exchange
- Needs are met through community (multiple people), not one person

### What it does NOT mean:
- Everyone must meet your needs
- Your need overrides someone's "no"
- You're entitled to specific help from specific people
- Needs = demands

**What this looks like:**
- "Can anyone help me move?" → people volunteer if they can ✓
- "You MUST help me move, I need it!" → demand ✗
- "Can anyone host me for a week while I find housing?" → asking ✓
- "You have a spare room so you OWE me housing" → entitlement ✗

**Mutual aid requires consent from both sides.** You give what you can. You receive what others can offer. The circle flows - but everyone gets to choose their participation.

## "Boundaries" Are Limits YOU Set, Not Demands on OTHERS

### What a boundary is:
- A limit YOU set about what YOU will do or accept
- About YOUR behavior, not controlling others
- Examples: "I can't talk after 8pm" or "I need you to stop using that nickname for me"

### What a boundary is NOT:
- Controlling someone else's behavior as a "boundary"
- A demand disguised as boundary language
- Examples: "Your boundary is you must answer my calls 24/7" ← That's a demand, not a boundary

**Real boundary:** "I only respond to messages during business hours"

**Fake "boundary":** "You must respond to my messages immediately because I need it"

**See the difference?** One is about what YOU will do. The other is trying to control what THEY must do.

**When someone sets a boundary with you, your "boundary" back cannot be forcing them to remove their boundary.** That's just violating their boundary with extra steps.

## "Neurodivergent-Affirming" Doesn't Mean "No Accountability"

### What it means:
- We respect different brain wiring
- Direct communication is valued
- You don't have to mask harmless traits (stimming, echolalia, etc.)
- We offer accommodations when possible

### What it does NOT mean:
- Your diagnosis excuses harmful behavior
- Accommodations = exemption from all rules
- You can violate boundaries because "that's just how I am"
- Other people must tolerate harm because you're neurodivergent

**Example:**
- ADHD makes waiting hard → Accommodation: We'll call on you first when we pause ✓
- ADHD makes waiting hard → Excuse to interrupt everyone constantly ✗

**We accommodate neurodivergence. We don't excuse harm.**

**Being neurodivergent doesn't make you a bad person. AND you're still responsible for the impact of your behavior.**

---

## "Crisis Changes Things" Doesn't Mean "No Boundaries During Crisis"

### What it means:
- We understand the November 2025 context (fascism, government shutdowns, people fleeing)
- We recognize intensity can be a normal response to extreme circumstances
- We offer grace when people are genuinely struggling
- The bar is different during collective crisis

### What it does NOT mean:
- Crisis = free pass to violate boundaries
- Desperation overrides people's limits
- Crisis means you can demand unlimited support
- Your crisis becomes everyone's crisis

**What doesn't change during crisis:**
- Respecting people's stated limits
- Using crisis resources (988, etc.) for actual crisis support
- Not threatening self-harm to prevent boundaries
- Recognizing facilitators/peers can't be your crisis team

**Crisis mutual aid looks like:**
- "Can anyone host me for 2 weeks while I sort my visa?" (asking, specific, temporary) ✓
- "You MUST let me stay as long as I want or you're abandoning me" (demanding, indefinite, manipulative) ✗

**Crisis IS NOT a free pass to violate boundaries.** Desperation is real. People's limits are also real. Both can be true.

## "No Saviors" Doesn't Mean "Refuse All Help/Resources"

### What it means:
- No one should position themselves as your rescuer or guru
- Dependency on one person isn't healthy
- You're capable, even when you need help

### What it does NOT mean:
- Refuse all help or support
- Don't listen to anyone's guidance
- Reject resource referrals
- No one can suggest things

**Example:**
- Someone positions themselves as the ONLY one who can help you, creating dependency ✗
- Someone says "I can't support you through this, but here's 988 and therapy resources" ✓

**Referring you to appropriate resources isn't a savior complex. It's responsible care.**

## When Someone Weaponizes These Terms

### What weaponization looks like:
- Using social justice/therapy language to avoid accountability
- Cherry-picking definitions to justify harmful behavior
- Accusing others of violating principles when boundaries are set
- Projection: accusing others of the exact behavior they're doing

### Examples:
- "You're violating horizontal relationships by enforcing rules!" (twisting the term)
- "Mutual aid means you HAVE to help me!" (misusing the concept)
- "Your boundary is gaslighting ME!" (weaponizing therapy speak)
- "I'm neurodivergent so you can't hold me accountable!" (using identity as shield)

### How to respond:
- Point to these definitions: "That's not what that term means"
- Hold your boundary regardless of how they label it
- Don't get drawn into debating terminology
- Recognize obvious bad faith (especially when pattern repeats)
- Talk to a facilitator if needed

**Genuinely confused people respond to clarification. Weaponizers double down.**

## Key Principles

**If you're genuinely confused:**
- Ask questions
- Read these definitions
- We'll clarify with patience
- Learning takes time

**If someone is weaponizing terms:**
- Facilitators will recognize the pattern
- These definitions make bad faith obvious
- We protect community safety

**Both compassion AND accountability can coexist.**

**Both your struggles AND others' boundaries can be real.**

**Both crisis context AND respect for limits matter.**
