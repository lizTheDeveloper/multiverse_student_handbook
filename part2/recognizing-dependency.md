# Recognizing Dependency: When Someone Expects You to Save Them

## You Can't Save Anyone

**And you're not supposed to.**

Helping is beautiful. Dependency is harmful.

This guide helps you recognize when someone is building unhealthy dependency on you—and how to set boundaries.

### Context: November 2025 - Mutual Aid During Crisis

**People are offering each other housing, resources, help fleeing.** This is mutual aid. This is beautiful. **AND** you still need boundaries.

**Crisis mutual aid is different from dependency:**
- **Mutual aid:** "I can host you for 2 weeks while you figure out your next step"
- **Dependency:** "You have to let me stay as long as I want or you're abandoning me"

**Crisis housing guidelines:**
- **Peers helping peers:** This is okay (with clear boundaries)
- **Student/teacher cohabitation:** Not allowed (power dynamic issues)
- **Know your limits:** Don't bite off more than you can chew
- **Set time limits:** "I can host for X weeks, then you need next plan"
- **You can change your mind** if it's not working

**See:** [Mutual Aid Guidelines](../part4/mutual-aid-guidelines.md) and [Cohabitation Policy](../part4/cohabitation-policy.md)

## What Dependency Looks Like

### Healthy Help vs. Dependency

| **Mutual Aid (Healthy)** | **Dependency (Unhealthy)** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Temporary support | Ongoing reliance |
| Reciprocal over time | One-sided taking |
| Empowers the person | Keeps them dependent |
| "How can I support you?" | "Fix this for me" |
| Clear boundaries | Boundary violations |
| They're working on it too | They expect you to solve it |
| Occasional | Constant |
| Multiple sources of support | You're their only support |

### Signs Someone Is Building Dependency

**They expect you to:**
- Be available 24/7
- Solve their problems for them
- Manage their emotions
- Be their therapist
- Be their only support
- Drop everything when they're in crisis
- Sacrifice your wellbeing for theirs

**When you set boundaries:**
- Guilt-tripping: "I thought you cared about me"
- Manipulation: "If you don't help me, I'll [harm myself/fail/etc]"
- Anger: "You're abandoning me"
- Weaponized vulnerability: "I'm struggling, how can you say no?"

**Patterns:**
- Repeated crises (always an emergency)
- Not following through on resources you give
- Venting endlessly without working on solutions
- Demanding more and more of your time
- Making you responsible for their wellbeing

## How Dependency Develops

### It Starts Innocently

**Phase 1: Helping**
- They ask for help
- You help (this is good!)
- They're grateful

**Phase 2: Escalation**
- They ask for more help
- The asks get bigger
- They expect you to always say yes
- You start feeling obligated

**Phase 3: Dependency**
- You're their primary support
- They're not building other resources
- You feel responsible for them
- You're exhausted

**Phase 4: Resentment**
- You're burned out
- You resent them
- You're avoiding them
- You feel guilty for pulling away

**This pattern is common. You're not a bad person for being in it.**

## Why People Build Dependency

### They're in Genuine Crisis (November 2025 Context)

**Right now, a LOT of people are in genuine crisis:**
- Fleeing fascism and targeting
- Trying to leave the country
- Losing access to resources (government shutdowns)
- Terrified, exhausted, overwhelmed
- Community scattered (people emigrating)

**Crisis need looks different from manipulative dependency:**

**Crisis need:**
- "Can you host me for 2 weeks while I get my visa sorted?"
- "I need help finding resources to leave"
- "Can someone help me figure out Thailand vs. Portugal?"
- Temporary, specific asks with effort on their part too

**Manipulative dependency:**
- "You have to save me or I'll die and it's your fault"
- No effort on their part, all demands on you
- Violates boundaries when you set them
- Threatens self-harm to control you
- Refuses to use any other resources

**The difference:** Are they working on their situation too? Do they respect your boundaries? Is it temporary or permanent expectation?

**Even when the need is real, you still can't save them.**

Your boundaries protect both of you - and let you help sustainably.

### They've Learned This Pattern

**Some people learned:**
- Helplessness gets attention
- Crisis gets care
- Dependency is connection
- They're not capable of solving problems

**This is often from:**
- Childhood patterns
- Past trauma
- Mental illness
- Lack of other skills

**Understanding why doesn't mean you have to tolerate it.**

### They're Manipulating

**Some people:**
- Deliberately create dependency
- Use crisis to control
- Test boundaries repeatedly
- Refuse to work on themselves

**This is emotional abuse.**

## Examples in Learning Communities

### Peer Dependency

**Looks like:**
- Constantly asking for help, never trying on their own
- Expecting you to debug their code for them
- DMing you every time they're stuck
- "Can you just do this for me?"
- Getting upset when you're not available
- Not using other resources (Google, documentation, other students)

**Why it's a problem:**
- They're not learning
- You're burning out
- They're not building problem-solving skills
- It's not sustainable

**What to do:**
- Point them to resources
- Teach them to fish, don't fish for them
- Set boundaries around availability
- "I can help point you in the right direction, but I can't solve this for you"

### Emotional Dependency

**Looks like:**
- Constant venting
- Expecting you to manage their feelings
- Crisis every day
- "You're the only one who understands me"
- Pulling away other support
- Weaponizing mental health ("If you don't talk to me, I'll hurt myself")

**Why it's a problem:**
- You're not their therapist
- You can't carry their emotional weight
- It's manipulative
- You have your own life/struggles

**What to do:**
- Encourage professional help
- Set boundaries around emotional labor
- "I care about you AND I can't be your therapist"
- If they threaten self-harm: take it seriously, but connect them to crisis resources (988, crisis line)

**See:** [When You're in Crisis](../part3/when-youre-in-crisis.md) for crisis resources

### Community Dependency

**Looks like:**
- Expecting the community to solve all their problems
- Not taking responsibility for their learning
- Constant crisis, never building stability
- Demanding accommodation beyond what's reasonable
- Claiming any boundary or accountability is discrimination

**Why it's a problem:**
- Community has limits
- Not everyone can carry everyone
- Mutual aid requires participation, not just taking

**Note:** Marginalization is real AND accountability is still real. Both can be true. Calling out actual discrimination is necessary. Using discrimination language to avoid all consequences for harmful behavior is manipulative.

**What communities can do:**
- Clear boundaries about what support is offered
- Connect to professional resources
- Set limits on crisis support
- Maintain accountability

## Setting Boundaries With Dependent People

### How to Say No

**You can help someone AND have boundaries.**

**Examples:**

**Instead of solving for them:**
> "I can help point you to resources, but I can't solve this for you."

**Instead of being available 24/7:**
> "I can respond during [hours], but I'm not available outside that time."

**Instead of being their therapist:**
> "I care about you, and I'm not equipped to help with that. Have you considered talking to [therapist/crisis line]?"

**Instead of debugging their code:**
> "What have you tried so far? What error messages are you seeing? Try [specific thing] and let me know what happens."

**When they guilt-trip:**
> "I understand you're struggling. My boundary stands."

### Enforcing Boundaries When They Push

**When they ignore your boundary:**

**First time:**
> "I set a boundary about [thing]. Please respect it."

**Second time:**
> "You've violated my boundary again. If this continues, I'll [consequence]."

**Consequences:**
- Stop responding
- Block/mute
- End the friendship
- Report to facilitator if in community setting

**You're not responsible for their reaction to your boundaries.**

## When to Walk Away

### You Can Leave

**Consider ending the relationship if:**
- They repeatedly violate boundaries
- They weaponize their struggles
- They're manipulative
- You're burning out
- They refuse to get professional help while demanding you be their support
- The relationship is one-sided

**You can:**
- Stop responding
- End the friendship
- Block them
- Leave the community if needed

**This isn't abandonment. This is self-preservation.**

### You're Not Responsible for Their Wellbeing

**Even if they:**
- Are struggling
- Don't have other support
- Threaten self-harm
- Beg you to stay

**You still get to leave.**

**If they threaten self-harm:**
1. Take it seriously
2. Connect them to crisis resources (988, crisis line, ER)
3. Tell a trusted person (facilitator, their family if appropriate)
4. But don't stay because of the threat

**Threatening self-harm to keep you is manipulation.** Even if they're genuinely struggling, you can't save them.

## Helping Without Creating Dependency

### Empower, Don't Rescue

**Instead of:**
- Solving their problem
- Being available 24/7
- Doing things for them
- Shielding them from consequences

**Try:**
- Pointing to resources
- Teaching problem-solving
- Having clear boundaries
- Letting them struggle (with support)

**Example - Code Help:**

**Creates dependency:**
> "Here's the answer. Here's the code. I fixed it for you."

**Empowers:**
> "What have you tried? What error are you getting? Have you looked at [documentation]? Try [specific debugging step]. Let me know what you learn."

**Example - Emotional Support:**

**Creates dependency:**
> "I'll always be here for you, no matter what. Text me anytime, day or night."

**Empowers:**
> "I care about you. I'm available [specific times]. For crisis support outside those times, here's [crisis line]. Have you considered therapy?"

### Mutual Aid, Not Saving

**Mutual aid means:**
- We help each other
- It's reciprocal
- Everyone contributes what they can
- Support is distributed (not one person carrying everything)
- We empower, not rescue

**See:** [Mutual Aid in Action](mutual-aid-in-action.md)

## Self-Awareness: Are You Creating Dependency?

### Check Yourself

**Ask:**
- Am I expecting one person to meet all my needs?
- Am I demanding more than is reasonable?
- Am I guilt-tripping when people set boundaries?
- Am I refusing to use other resources?
- Am I working on my problems, or just venting?
- Do I respect people's time and energy limits?

**If you're building dependency:**
- Diversify your support (therapist, multiple friends, crisis lines, community)
- Respect boundaries
- Work on your problems (therapy, resources, action)
- Take responsibility for your wellbeing

**See:** [Self-Awareness](self-awareness.md)

## For Facilitators: Managing Dependency

**See admin handbook:** [Vision vs. Delusion](vision-vs-delusion.md)

**Quick version:**
- Have clear boundaries about what support you offer
- Connect students to professional resources early
- Don't become their therapist
- Model healthy boundaries
- It's okay to say "I can't help with that"

## Remember

**Helping is beautiful. Dependency is harmful.**

**You can care about someone AND have boundaries.**

**You're not responsible for saving anyone.**

**You can't pour from an empty cup.**

**Setting boundaries is kindness—to them and to yourself.**
