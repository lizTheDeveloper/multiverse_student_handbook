# Boundary Violations & Love-Bombing

## For Everyone in the Community

Boundaries in neurodivergent communities require special consideration. Many neurodivergent people have experienced:
- Forced compliance with neurotypical social norms
- Rejection for "inappropriate" behavior that was actually communication differences
- Trauma from institutions and relationships that violated their autonomy
- Difficulty reading implied social cues

**Our approach:** Be explicit about boundaries, distinguish between communication differences and boundary violations, and use transformative justice rather than punishment.

**This guide helps you:**
- Understand what boundaries are (and aren't)
- Recognize communication differences vs. actual violations
- Understand love-bombing patterns (in yourself or others)
- Know why facilitators respond the way they do

---

## What Are Boundaries?

Boundaries are agreements about how we interact in shared spaces. They protect:
- Individual autonomy and consent
- Community safety and sustainability
- Everyone's wellbeing and capacity
- The learning environment's integrity

**Key principle from disability justice:** Boundaries are not about forcing neurotypical social performance. They're about consent, safety, and mutual respect.

## Communication Differences vs. Boundary Violations

### Communication Differences (NOT Violations)
These are neurodivergent communication styles that may seem "inappropriate" but aren't harmful:

**Direct/Blunt communication**
- Autistic people often communicate directly without social softening
- *Example:* "That explanation was confusing" instead of "I'm sorry, but I'm having a little trouble understanding..."
- **This is okay!** We accept and appreciate directness here

**Literal interpretation**
- Missing implied meanings or social hints
- *Example:* Continuing a conversation when someone says "I should get going" (an implied goodbye)
- **What helps:** People being explicit: "I need to end this conversation now"

**Info-dumping**
- Sharing extensive information about special interests
- *Example:* Long messages about a topic you're passionate about
- **What helps:** People setting limits: "I can read 2-3 paragraphs max. Can you summarize?"

**Asking questions others find "too personal"**
- *Example:* "How much money do you make?" or "Why don't you have kids?"
- **What helps:** People saying directly: "That's a personal question I don't answer"

**If someone tells you they have a boundary about your communication:**
- This isn't rejection of YOU
- It's information about their capacity
- Adjust your behavior, don't take it personally
- Thank them for being explicit

---

### Actual Boundary Violations
These behaviors cause harm regardless of neurotype:

- **Repeated unwanted contact after being asked to stop**
- **Sexual or romantic advances toward facilitators/peers after being told no**
- **Excessive private messaging, especially late at night**
- **Sharing others' private information without consent**
- **Following or surveilling someone across platforms**
- **Threatening self-harm to manipulate responses**
- **Demanding immediate responses or constant availability**

**If someone tells you you're violating a boundary:**
- Stop the behavior immediately
- Apologize
- Adjust going forward
- If you're confused, ask for clarification: "Can you help me understand what boundary I crossed?"

**If someone is violating YOUR boundaries:**
- Name it directly: "Please stop messaging me after 8pm"
- Tell a facilitator if it continues
- You're allowed to protect yourself

## Love-Bombing: What It Looks Like

Love-bombing is intense, overwhelming expressions of affection, gratitude, or connection used to create rapid intimacy. It can be:
- **Intentional manipulation** (narcissistic or predatory behavior)
- **Trauma response** (attachment disorders, testing for rejection)
- **Neurodivergent social communication** (intense genuine feelings expressed without social filtering)

### Examples in Community Contexts

**Toward facilitators:**
- "You're the only teacher who's ever understood me"
- "This school saved my life, you're my real family"
- Excessive gifts, praise, or declarations of gratitude
- Rapid escalation to deep personal sharing within days
- Positioning facilitator as savior, guru, or soulmate

**Toward peers:**
- "You're my best friend" after one conversation
- Constant messaging, declarations of connection
- Intense vulnerability sharing too quickly
- Jealousy when they connect with others

---

## Why It's Problematic

Even when well-intentioned, love-bombing creates:
- **Unequal pressure** — Puts pressure on others to reciprocate
- **Boundary erosion** — Makes it harder to maintain healthy distance
- **Community disruption** — Others feel less valued or jealous
- **Setup for disappointment** — When people maintain boundaries, you feel rejected and may spiral

**From transformative justice lens:** The harm isn't in the feeling—it's in how the intensity impacts others' autonomy and safety.

---

## If You Recognize Love-Bombing Patterns in Yourself

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I tell new people they're "the only one who gets me"?
- Do I share deep trauma or vulnerability very quickly?
- Do I give excessive gifts or praise?
- Do I feel crushed when people set boundaries with me?
- Do I position one person as uniquely able to help/understand me?
- Do I test whether they'll "really" care by escalating intensity?

**If yes:**
- This is often a trauma response (you're not broken)
- It comes from real pain and real needs
- AND it pushes people away
- Consider therapy to work on attachment patterns
- Build a support network (multiple people, not one special person)
- Practice slower relationship building

## How Facilitators Respond to Boundary Violations

### When a facilitator sets a boundary with you:

**They'll say something like:**
> "I notice you've sent me 12 messages tonight. Our community guideline is that facilitators aren't available for DMs after 8pm. Please use the async discussion channel or wait until tomorrow."

> "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but calling me your 'soul teacher' makes me uncomfortable. I'm here to facilitate learning, not to be a guru or family member."

> "You've asked me three times to review your work today. I can respond once every 48 hours. Let's talk about what support structure would help you manage waiting."

**They'll explain the impact:**
> "When you message late at night repeatedly, it impacts my sleep and my ability to be present for all students."

> "Intense declarations of connection can feel like pressure to respond in kind, which isn't appropriate in a facilitator-student relationship."

**They'll offer alternatives:**
> "If you need immediate support, here's the crisis line: 988. For class questions, use the forum where everyone benefits from seeing the answer."

> "If you want to express appreciation, a simple 'thank you' is enough. You don't need to perform gratitude."

---

### What Happens After One Boundary-Setting:

**If you adjust:** Great! Everyone moves forward.

**If the behavior continues:**
- Facilitators will escalate to admin
- There may be documentation
- Continued violations may result in community pause

**If it escalates (threats, stalking, manipulation):**
- Immediate removal from community spaces

**Transparency:** Facilitators document serious boundary violations to protect everyone, including you.

## Understanding Attachment Trauma

Many neurodivergent people have experienced:
- Rejection and abandonment
- Inconsistent caregiving
- Institutional trauma
- Social isolation

**This context matters** — but it doesn't negate the need for boundaries.

**Transformative approach (what facilitators do):**
- Acknowledge your pain: *"I hear that connection is really important to you, especially if you've been hurt before."*
- Hold the boundary: *"And also, I need to maintain a professional role here."*
- Redirect to appropriate support: *"I want to make sure you have people in your life who can offer the kind of relationship you're seeking. That's not me, but here are some peer support resources."*

**What this means for you:**
- Your trauma is real
- Your need for connection is valid
- AND you're responsible for respecting boundaries
- Get therapy to work on attachment patterns

## When Neurodivergent Communication Gets Misread

### Scenario 1: Autistic Literalism

**Facilitator says:** "Sure, message me anytime!"
**You:** Message at 2am regularly
**Facilitator:** "Please don't message after 8pm"

**What happened:** Facilitator used social language ("anytime" = "during reasonable hours"). You took it literally.

**What to do:** Adjust when you get explicit boundary. No shame—ask for clarity upfront.

---

### Scenario 2: ADHD Hyperfocus

**You:** Send 10-message thread about an idea at 11pm

**What happened:** Got excited and hyperfocused, lost track of time and social norms

**What helps:** Set alarms for boundary times, consolidate messages, send during daytime

---

### Scenario 3: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

**Facilitator:** Sets a boundary
**You:** Have intense emotional meltdown, feel rejected or attacked

**What happened:** RSD (common in ADHD) causes extreme emotional response to perceived criticism

**What to do:**
- Notice the intensity (it's disproportionate to what happened)
- Take space before responding
- Remember: boundary ≠ rejection
- Self-soothe, don't demand they remove the boundary
- Get therapy for RSD management

**What facilitators will do:**
- Stay calm and grounded
- Reaffirm care without removing boundary: *"I care about your wellbeing. This boundary isn't rejection—it's how I stay sustainable."*
- Give space for feelings: *"I can see you're upset. Take some time, and we can talk when you're ready."*
- They will NOT remove the boundary to soothe your feelings

**See:** [Burnout & Community Sustainability](../part5/burnout-and-community-sustainability.md) for why boundaries matter

## If Someone Is Violating YOUR Boundaries

### Step 1: Name It Directly (No Shame Required)

Use clear language:
> "Please don't message me after 8pm."

> "I can't be your primary support person. Let's talk about building your support network."

> "That question is too personal for me. Let's keep our conversations focused on [topic]."

### Step 2: If It Continues:

- Tell a facilitator
- Document (screenshots, dates, what you said)
- Set consequences: "If you continue, I'll need to block you"
- Block if necessary

### Step 3: Don't Feel Guilty

- You're allowed to have boundaries
- You're not responsible for managing their feelings
- Self-care enables community care

## Common Boundary Scenarios

### Scenario: Someone Messages You Constantly

**What to say:**
> "I can only check messages once a day. Please consolidate your thoughts into 1-2 messages."

**If it continues:**
> "I set a boundary about messaging frequency. This is my last reminder. If it continues, I'll need to mute our conversation."

---

### Scenario: Someone Shares Heavy Trauma Without Consent

**What to say:**
> "I can see you're going through a lot. I'm not the right person for this conversation. Have you talked to a therapist? Here's the crisis line: 988."

**If it continues:**
> "I need you to stop sharing trauma details with me. I care about you, but I can't be your therapist. Please use these resources: [list]."

---

### Scenario: Someone Love-Bombs You

**What to say:**
> "I appreciate that you value our connection. The intensity feels like pressure to me. Can we dial it back?"

**If it continues:**
> "I need you to stop calling me your best friend/soul person/only support. We've known each other [short time]. Please build a broader support network."

## Key Principles

1. **Be explicit, not implicit** — Don't expect people to guess your boundaries
2. **Distinguish communication style from violation** — Direct ≠ rude, info-dumping ≠ harassment
3. **Name impact, not intent** — Focus on what happened, not why
4. **One clear chance, then act** — Grace with accountability
5. **You're allowed to protect yourself** — Setting boundaries isn't mean
6. **Trauma explains behavior but doesn't excuse it** — Get help for patterns

---

## Red Lines (Immediate Facilitator Escalation)

Tell a facilitator immediately if someone:
- Threatens violence or self-harm as manipulation
- Makes sexual harassment or advances after being told no
- Stalks you across multiple platforms
- Shares your private information to retaliate
- Recruits others against you or staff

**Facilitators will:** Remove them from community spaces immediately, document, potentially disaffiliate.

> **Guiding principle:** Neurodivergent people deserve explicit communication AND accountability for respecting boundaries. Both are true. Both are necessary.
