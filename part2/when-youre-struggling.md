# When You're Struggling

## It's Okay to Struggle

Learning is hard. Life is hard. Sometimes everything feels like too much.

**This is normal.** You're not failing. You're human.

## What Struggling Looks Like

You might be struggling if:

**Academically:**
- Can't focus on lessons
- Exercises feel impossible
- You're falling behind
- Nothing makes sense
- You're avoiding everything

**Emotionally:**
- Overwhelmed
- Anxious or depressed
- Burned out
- Numb
- Constantly on edge

**Physically:**

## What to Do Right Now

### If You're in Crisis

**Go to:** [When You're in Crisis](../part3/when-youre-in-crisis.md)

**Quick crisis numbers:**
- **988** - Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- **Text HOME to 741741** - Crisis Text Line

### If You're Struggling But Not in Crisis

**1. Name it**
- "I'm struggling"
- "This is hard"
- "I need help"

**2. Tell someone**
- Facilitator
- Peer in Multiverse
- Friend outside Multiverse
- Therapist
- Family member

**3. Ask for what you need** (see below)

---

## Asking for Help in Multiverse

### What Facilitators Can Offer

**We can:**
- Listen
- Help you break down what's overwhelming
- Point you to resources
- Adjust expectations temporarily
- Give you space if you need it
- Check in on you
- Celebrate small wins

**We can't:**
- Be available 24/7
- Replace your therapist
- Solve all your problems
- Do the learning for you
- Make the struggle disappear

### What to Say

**Good asks:**
- "I'm overwhelmed. Can you help me figure out where to start?"
- "I'm struggling with [thing]. Can we talk about it?"
- "I need a break from [activity]. Can I step back for a bit?"
- "I'm having a hard time. Can you point me to resources?"

**Boundary-violating asks:**
- "Be available to me 24/7"
- "Solve this for me"
- "Change the curriculum because I'm struggling"
- "Let me vent endlessly without working on it"

**See:** [Student Boundaries](student-boundaries.md)

### What Peers Can Offer

**Peers can:**
- Listen
- Share their own struggles
- Offer solidarity
- Study together (body doubling)
- Share resources
- Celebrate wins

**Peers can't:**
- Be your therapist
- Save you
- Carry your emotional weight indefinitely

**See:** [Mutual Aid in Action](mutual-aid-in-action.md)

## Breaking Down Overwhelm

### When Everything Feels Like Too Much

**Try this:**

1. **Brain dump** - Write down everything overwhelming you
2. **Categorize:**
   - **Crisis:** Needs immediate attention (housing, food, safety)
   - **Urgent:** Needs attention soon
   - **Important but not urgent**
   - **Can wait**
3. **Pick ONE thing** from crisis or urgent
4. **Break it into smallest possible step**
5. **Do that one step**

**Example:**
- Overwhelm: "I'm behind on everything"
- Brain dump: Rent due, 3 exercises not done, haven't eaten today, anxious about chat, need therapy
- Crisis: Haven't eaten today
- First step: Eat something
- Do it: Make toast

### Smallest Possible Steps

**For "I can't do this exercise":**
- Smallest step: Read the exercise description
- Next smallest: Open your code editor
- Next: Write one line of code
- Next: Run it and see what happens

**For "I can't show up to community":**
- Smallest step: Read the chat (don't respond)
- Next smallest: React to one message with emoji
- Next: Say "hi"
- Next: Answer one question

**You don't have to do everything. Do one tiny thing.**

## When You Need a Break

### It's Okay to Step Back

**You can:**
- Take a break from exercises
- Lurk in chat instead of participating
- Skip synchronous sessions
- Focus on survival instead of learning
- Come back when you're ready

**This doesn't make you a bad student.** It makes you someone taking care of yourself.

### Telling People You're Stepping Back

**To facilitator:**
> "I'm struggling right now and need to step back from [thing]. I'll check back in [timeframe]."

**To community:**
> "I'm taking a break for my mental health. I'll be back when I can."

**You don't owe anyone an explanation beyond this.**

## When Learning Feels Impossible

### Learning IS Hard

**Normal struggles:**
- Confusion (learning literally requires not knowing)
- Frustration (things don't work the first time)
- Slow progress (expertise takes years, not weeks)
- Comparison (everyone else seems to get it faster)
- Imposter syndrome (feeling like you don't belong)

**When it becomes too much:**
- Can't concentrate at all
- Every tiny thing feels impossible
- You're avoiding everything
- Panic when you try to start
- Physical symptoms (nausea, racing heart, etc.)

**This might mean:**
- You need a break
- You need mental health support
- You need to address something else first (housing, safety, crisis)
- Your brain needs different accommodations

### Working With Your Brain

**If you're neurodivergent:**
- [Neurodivergent Resources](../part7/neurodivergent-resources.md)
- You might need different strategies (body doubling, shorter sessions, external structure)

**If you're dealing with trauma:**
- Learning activates your nervous system
- Ground yourself first
- Take breaks
- [Therapy Resources](../part7/therapy-resources.md)

**If you're in survival mode:**
- You can't focus on learning when you're worried about housing/food/safety
- **Address survival needs first**
- [Survival Resources](../part7/survival-resources.md)

## Comparing Yourself to Others

### Everyone Is on a Different Timeline

**What you see:**
- "They finished that exercise in 2 hours"
- "They already know how to do this"
- "They're contributing so much to chat"
- "Everyone else is ahead of me"

**What you don't see:**
- They might have prior experience
- They might be struggling too (just hiding it)
- They might have more time
- They might have fewer other stressors
- They might be in a different life stage

**Your timeline is your timeline.** Comparison steals joy.

### Imposter Syndrome

**Feeling like:**
- You don't belong here
- Everyone else is smarter
- You're faking it
- You'll be "found out"

**Truth:**
- Most people feel this way
- Feeling like an imposter often means you're learning (you're aware of what you don't know)
- You DO belong here

**Helpful reframe:** "I'm learning. Of course I don't know everything yet."

## Getting Professional Support

### When to Get Help

**Consider therapy/medication if:**
- Struggling is constant, not situational
- You can't function in daily life
- You've tried self-help and it's not enough
- You're in crisis repeatedly
- You have suicidal thoughts
- You suspect mental illness

**See:**
- [Therapy Resources](../part7/therapy-resources.md)
- [Understanding Yourself](../part3/understanding-yourself.md)
- [Mental Health Support](../part3/mental-health-support.md)

### You Can Do Both

**You can:**
- Be in therapy AND learning to code
- Take medication AND participate in Multiverse
- Have mental illness AND build things
- Struggle AND belong here

**These aren't mutually exclusive.**

---

## Survival Mode vs. Learning Mode

### You Can't Learn When You're Just Surviving

**Maslow's hierarchy is real:**
- If you don't have housing, you can't focus on code
- If you're starving, you can't learn
- If you're unsafe, your brain is in threat mode

**This doesn't make you weak. This is how brains work.**

### Address Survival First

**If you're in survival mode:**
1. **Secure basics:** Housing, food, safety
2. **Access resources:** [Survival Resources](../part7/survival-resources.md)
3. **Let learning wait:** It'll be here when you're ready

**Multiverse will still be here.** Take care of yourself first.

---

## Small Wins

### Celebrate Tiny Progress

**Learning doesn't have to be:**
- Finishing exercises
- Building big projects
- Contributing to chat constantly
- Being the "best" student

**Learning can be:**
- Reading one article
- Writing one line of code
- Asking one question
- Showing up (even just lurking)
- Understanding one concept
- Trying something that doesn't work (that's data!)

**Progress is progress.** Even tiny.

---

## Mutual Aid

### You're Not Alone

**Ask for help:**
- [Mutual Aid in Action](mutual-aid-in-action.md)
- Community can support you
- Facilitators care

**Offer help (when you can):**
- Mutual aid isn't charity
- We all struggle
- We all support each other

---

## Remember

**Struggling doesn't make you a bad student.**

**Everyone struggles sometimes.**

**You're allowed to need help.**

**You're allowed to take breaks.**

**You belong here even when it's hard.**
