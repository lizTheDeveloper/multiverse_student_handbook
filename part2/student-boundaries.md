# Student Boundaries: How to Set Them

## You're Allowed to Have Boundaries

Boundaries aren't selfish. They're necessary.

You can participate in community AND protect your wellbeing.

---

## What Are Boundaries?

**Boundaries are:**
- Limits that protect your time, energy, and wellbeing
- Communication about what works and doesn't work for you
- Self-care, not rejection

**Boundaries aren't:**
- Controlling others
- Punishment
- Walls that keep everyone out

**Example boundaries:**
- "I can't respond to DMs after 9pm"
- "I need to step back from chat for a while"
- "I can't help with that right now"
- "Please don't share my personal information"

---

## Why Boundaries Matter

### Without Boundaries

**You might:**
- Burn out
- Resent people
- Feel overwhelmed
- Isolate completely
- Get taken advantage of

### With Boundaries

**You can:**
- Participate sustainably
- Enjoy community
- Take care of yourself
- Be present when you are here
- Ask for what you need

**Boundaries make community possible.**

## Common Boundaries in Multiverse

### Time Boundaries

**Examples:**
- "I can only be in chat during [hours]"
- "I can't attend synchronous sessions right now"
- "I need to limit my screen time to [amount]"
- "I'm taking weekends off"

**How to communicate:**
> "I'm setting a boundary around my time. I'll be active in chat [when], but not available outside those hours."

### Energy Boundaries

**Examples:**
- "I can't help troubleshoot right now"
- "I need to lurk for a while, not actively participate"
- "I can't take on any collaborative projects"
- "I'm focusing on my own learning right now"

**How to communicate:**
> "I don't have the energy to help with that. I need to focus on [thing]."

### Emotional Boundaries

**Examples:**
- "I can't be a sounding board for [topic]"
- "Please don't vent to me about [thing]"
- "I need emotional support, not advice right now"
- "I can't process heavy topics today"

**How to communicate:**
> "I care about you, and I don't have capacity for that conversation right now."

### Privacy Boundaries

**Examples:**
- "Don't share my personal information"
- "I'm not comfortable discussing [topic]"
- "Please ask before screenshotting my messages"
- "Don't DM me without asking first"

**How to communicate:**
> "I'm not comfortable sharing that. Thanks for understanding."

## How to Set Boundaries

### 1. Identify What You Need

**Ask yourself:**
- What makes me uncomfortable?
- What drains my energy?
- What do I resent?
- What am I avoiding?
- What would make participation sustainable?

**These answers point to needed boundaries.**

### 2. Communicate Clearly

**Structure:**
1. State the boundary
2. (Optional) Brief reason
3. What you need

**Examples:**

**Good:**
> "I need to step back from DMs for my mental health. Please only message me in public chat for now."

**Also good:**
> "I can't help with that. My bandwidth is maxed."

**Too much explanation:**
> "I'm so sorry, I'm just really overwhelmed right now and my therapist said I need to protect my energy and I feel terrible but I just can't help with that and I hope you understand and I'm sorry if this is disappointing..."

**You don't owe lengthy justifications.** State your boundary and move on.

### 3. Enforce Your Boundary

**If someone violates your boundary:**

**First time:**
> "I asked you not to [thing]. Please respect that boundary."

**Second time:**
> "You've violated my boundary twice. If it happens again, I'll [consequence]."

**Possible consequences:**
- Block/mute them
- Stop responding
- Report to facilitator
- Leave the conversation

**You're allowed to enforce boundaries.**

## Responding to Others' Boundaries

### When Someone Sets a Boundary With You

**Good responses:**
- "Thanks for letting me know"
- "I understand"
- "I'll respect that"
- *Just respect it without commentary*

**Boundary-violating responses:**
- "But I really need..."
- "You're being sensitive"
- "I thought we were friends"
- "Just this once?"
- Ignoring the boundary

**If you accidentally violate someone's boundary:**
> "I'm sorry. I'll respect that going forward."

**Then actually respect it.**

---

## Boundaries With Facilitators

### You Can Set Boundaries With Facilitators

**Examples:**
- "I need to take a break from [activity]"
- "I can't make synchronous sessions right now"
- "I need feedback delivered [specific way]"
- "Please don't check in on me right now; I'll reach out when I'm ready"

**Facilitators are human with boundaries too.**

**They might say:**
- "I can't respond to DMs after [time]"
- "I need you to ask in public chat so others can learn too"
- "I can't help with that; it's outside my expertise"
- "I need to refer you to [resource] for that"

**This isn't rejection. It's sustainability.**

## Boundaries With Peers

### Helping vs. Over-Functioning

**It's okay to:**
- Help when you have capacity
- Say no when you don't
- Offer resources instead of solving

**It's NOT okay to:**
- Become someone's personal tutor/therapist
- Sacrifice your wellbeing to help
- Take on their learning

**See:** [Recognizing Dependency](recognizing-dependency.md)

### Mutual Aid Has Limits

**Mutual aid:**
- We help each other
- It's reciprocal over time
- Everyone contributes what they can

**Not mutual aid:**
- One person constantly taking
- No reciprocity
- Expectation that you'll always be available

**You can participate in mutual aid AND have boundaries.**

## When Someone Ignores Your Boundaries

### Boundary Violations Are Serious

**If someone repeatedly ignores your boundaries:**

1. **Name it directly**
   > "I've set a boundary about [thing] multiple times. You keep violating it. This isn't okay."

2. **Enforce consequences**
   - Block/mute
   - Stop engaging
   - Report to facilitator

3. **Get support**
   - Talk to facilitator
   - Document violations
   - You're not overreacting

**See:** [Code of Conduct](../part4/multiverse-code-of-conduct.md)

### You Don't Have to Justify Boundaries

**If someone demands you justify:**
- You don't owe explanations
- "Because I said so" is valid
- Protect yourself first

**Manipulative responses to boundaries:**
- Guilt-tripping ("I thought you cared about me")
- Arguing ("That's not a reasonable boundary")
- Demanding explanations ("But WHY?")
- Ignoring and hoping you'll give up

**These are red flags.** Your boundaries are valid even if someone else doesn't like them.

## Boundaries Around Helping

### You're Not Required to Help

**Just because you know something doesn't mean you have to teach it.**

**Saying no:**
> "I don't have capacity to help right now."

> "I'd recommend checking [resource] for that."

> "Maybe ask in the main chat so others can chime in too?"

**You don't have to:**
- Pair program if you don't want to
- Review someone's code
- Troubleshoot their bugs
- Explain concepts
- Be available for questions

**Helping is generous. It's not owed.**

---

## Boundaries Around Venting/Emotional Labor

### Community Isn't Therapy

**It's okay to:**
- Share that you're struggling
- Ask for support
- Vent occasionally

**It's NOT okay to:**
- Use community as free therapy
- Dump heavy emotional content without consent
- Expect people to manage your emotions
- Repeatedly vent without working on solutions

### Setting Boundaries Around Venting

**If someone is venting at you:**

**Ask for consent first:**
> "Can I vent for a minute?" (They can say no)

**If they're venting without consent:**
> "I don't have capacity for this right now. Have you talked to [therapist/crisis line]?"

**If it's overwhelming:**
> "This is heavy. I care about you, and I need to step back from this conversation."

**See:** [Recognizing Dependency](recognizing-dependency.md)

---

## Self-Awareness: Are You Respecting Boundaries?

### Check Yourself

**Ask:**
- Have I asked for consent before venting/asking for help?
- Am I respecting when people say no?
- Am I expecting one person to meet all my needs?
- Am I demanding more than someone can give?
- Am I guilt-tripping when people set boundaries?

**See:** [Self-Awareness](self-awareness.md)

## Cultural Differences & Boundaries

### Boundaries Look Different Across Cultures

**Some cultures:**
- Emphasize community over individual needs
- Have different norms around directness
- Frame boundaries differently

**In Multiverse:**
- You're allowed to set boundaries however works for you
- Direct communication is encouraged (but not required)
- Your boundaries are valid even if they differ from your culture of origin

**Navigating this:**
- You can honor your culture AND set boundaries
- Find language that works for you
- Boundaries can look different and still be respected

---

## Boundaries & Marginalized Identities

### When Boundaries Are Harder

**For marginalized people, boundaries can be:**
- Interpreted as "angry" or "difficult"
- Punished more harshly
- Seen as not being a "team player"

**This is real. AND:**
- You still deserve boundaries
- Your boundaries are valid
- Pushback doesn't mean you're wrong

**Multiverse commits to:**
- Respecting boundaries across identities
- Not tone-policing
- Believing people when they say a boundary is violated

**See:** [Code of Conduct](../part4/multiverse-code-of-conduct.md)

---

## Remember

**Boundaries are self-care, not selfishness.**

**You can participate in community AND protect yourself.**

**"No" is a complete sentence.**

**You don't owe anyone your time, energy, or attention.**

**Your boundaries are valid even if someone else doesn't like them.**
