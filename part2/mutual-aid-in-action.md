# Mutual Aid in Action: Asking For and Offering Help

## We Help Each Other

Mutual aid is the foundation of The Multiverse School.

**Mutual aid isn't charity.** It's reciprocal support based on solidarity.

This guide helps you ask for help, offer help, and build sustainable community support.

## What Is Mutual Aid?

### Mutual Aid vs. Charity

| **Mutual Aid** | **Charity** |
|---------------|-------------|
| Horizontal (peer to peer) | Vertical (helper → helpless) |
| "How can we help each other?" | "I'll help you" |
| Reciprocal over time | One-way giving |
| Solidarity | Pity |
| Everyone has something to offer | Some people only receive |
| Dignity-preserving | Can be dehumanizing |
| Addresses root causes | Band-aid solutions |
| "We're in this together" | "I'm lucky, you're not" |

**Mutual aid recognizes:** We all struggle. We all have gifts. We support each other.

### Principles

**1. Solidarity, not charity**
- We're interconnected
- Your liberation is tied to mine
- We help because we're all in this together

**2. Everyone has something to offer**
- Skills, knowledge, time, presence, resources
- Receiving ≠ being helpless
- Giving ≠ being superior

**3. Reciprocity (over time)**
- Not transactional ("I helped you, now you owe me")
- Trust it balances over time
- Some people give more in some seasons, receive more in others

**4. Meeting needs directly**
- Practical support
- Not bureaucracy
- "What do you need?" → provide it

## Asking for Help

### It's Okay to Ask

**You're not:**
- Being a burden
- Weak
- Failing
- Too much

**You're:**
- Human
- Part of community
- Participating in mutual aid

**Asking for help is brave.**

### How to Ask

**Structure:**
1. Name what you need
2. Be specific
3. Make it easy to say yes or no

**Examples:**

**Good asks:**

> "I'm stuck on this bug. Can someone take a look? Here's the error: [error]. I've tried [things I've tried]."

> "I'm struggling with [concept]. Does anyone have a resource that helped them understand it?"

> "I'm having a hard time today and could use some encouragement."

> "I need to talk through this project idea. Anyone have 30 minutes this week?"

> "I'm overwhelmed. Can someone help me break this down into steps?"

**Less effective asks:**

> "Can someone help me?" (Too vague - help with what?)

> "I'm stuck." (Okay, on what? What have you tried?)

> "Someone debug this for me." (Demanding, not asking)

> "I need help NOW." (Urgent demands without context)

### Asking for Code Help

**Make it easy to help you:**

1. **Say what you're trying to do**
2. **Share the specific error or problem**
3. **Say what you've already tried**
4. **Share relevant code** (formatted, not screenshot)
5. **Link to documentation you've read**

**Example:**

> "I'm trying to set up authentication with JWT. I'm getting this error: [error]. I've tried [thing] and [thing] based on [documentation]. Here's my code: [link]. Any ideas?"

**This gives people what they need to help.**

### When to Ask in Public vs. DM

**Ask in public chat when:**
- It's technical help (others can learn)
- Multiple people might have answers
- It's not sensitive/private

**Ask in DM when:**
- It's personal
- Sensitive information
- One-on-one makes sense

**Facilitators may redirect DMs to public chat** so others can learn too.

## Offering Help

### How to Help Without Creating Dependency

**Good helping:**
- ✅ Point to resources
- ✅ Ask what they've tried
- ✅ Teach problem-solving, not just solutions
- ✅ Empower them to solve it
- ✅ Have boundaries

**Creates dependency:**
- ❌ Always solving for them
- ❌ Being available 24/7
- ❌ Doing things they could do themselves
- ❌ Rescuing instead of teaching

**See:** [Recognizing Dependency](recognizing-dependency.md)

### The "Teach to Fish" Approach

**Instead of:**
> "Here's the answer. Copy this code."

**Try:**
> "What have you tried so far? Have you looked at [resource]? What do you think might be causing this? Try [specific debugging step] and let me know what you learn."

**You're helping them build:**
- Problem-solving skills
- Confidence
- Independence
- Learning how to learn

### Helping With Code

**Scaffold, don't solve:**

1. **Ask what they've tried** - "What have you done so far?"
2. **Point to resources** - "Have you checked [documentation/tutorial]?"
3. **Help them debug** - "What's the error message? Let's read it together."
4. **Teach debugging** - "Try console.log here. What does it output?"
5. **Let them struggle (with support)** - Struggle is learning

**When to give the answer:**
- They've truly tried everything
- They're about to give up entirely
- It's a tiny syntax thing blocking progress
- Time pressure is real

**Even then:** Explain why, don't just give it.

### Helping With Emotional Stuff

**You can:**
- Listen
- Validate ("That sounds really hard")
- Share resources
- Offer solidarity ("I've been there")
- Ask "What do you need right now?"

**You can't:**
- Be their therapist
- Fix their problems
- Be available 24/7
- Carry their emotional weight indefinitely

**It's okay to say:**
> "I care about you, and I'm not equipped to help with that. Have you considered talking to [therapist/crisis line/resource]?"

**See:** [Student Boundaries](student-boundaries.md)

## Setting Boundaries in Mutual Aid

### You Can Help AND Have Limits

**Boundaries help mutual aid be sustainable.**

**You can say:**
- "I can help with that for 30 minutes"
- "I don't have capacity right now, but here's [resource]"
- "I can answer questions in chat, but I can't DM about this"
- "I need to focus on my own work today"
- "I can help, but not right now—can it wait until [time]?"

**These aren't rejection. They're sustainability.**

### When to Say No

**Say no when:**
- You don't have capacity
- It would harm your wellbeing
- They're asking you to do it for them (not help them learn)
- They're not respecting your boundaries
- You're starting to resent helping

**"No" is:**
- Complete
- Valid
- Part of mutual aid (you can't give from empty)

## Receiving Help Gracefully

### How to Receive

**Good receiving:**
- Thank people
- Try their suggestions
- Report back (people like to know their help worked!)
- Pay it forward when you can

**Poor receiving:**
- Arguing with suggestions
- Not trying them
- Demanding more
- Acting entitled
- Ghosting after getting help

### When Help Doesn't Work

**If their suggestion doesn't work:**

> "Thanks! I tried that and [what happened]. I'm going to try [next thing]."

**Not:**
> "That didn't work. What else?"

**You're:**
- Still responsible for your problem
- Grateful for their time
- Not entitled to them solving it for you

---

## Reciprocity

### How to Give Back

**Reciprocity doesn't mean:**
- Immediate payback
- Transactional exchange
- You owe the specific person

**Reciprocity means:**
- Over time, you contribute too
- When you can
- In whatever way works for you

**Ways to contribute:**
- Share what you build
- Answer questions when you know things
- Offer encouragement
- Share resources
- Be present
- Celebrate others' wins

**You don't have to be "expert" to contribute.** Beginners help other beginners.

### When You Can't Give Back Right Now

**Sometimes you're in:**
- Crisis
- Survival mode
- Burnout
- Overwhelm

**You can't give when you're empty. That's okay.**

**Mutual aid trust:** When you can't contribute, community holds you. When you can, you hold others.

## Building Mutual Aid Culture

### How Community Works

**Mutual aid communities:**
- Share resources freely
- Ask for help without shame
- Offer help without superiority
- Trust reciprocity over time
- Support the most vulnerable
- Recognize everyone has value

**Not mutual aid:**
- Hoarding knowledge
- Gatekeeping
- "Figure it out yourself"
- Shaming people for needing help
- Expecting perfection
- Transactional relationships

### Your Role

**You help build mutual aid by:**
- Asking when you need help
- Offering when you can
- Respecting boundaries (yours and others')
- Not shaming people for needs
- Sharing what you learn
- Celebrating others
- Being part of the web of support

## Mutual Aid ≠ Codependency

### The Difference

**Mutual aid:**
- Distributed support
- Boundaries respected
- Empowering
- Reciprocal
- Sustainable

**Codependency:**
- One person responsible for another
- Boundary violations
- Creates dependency
- One-sided
- Leads to burnout

**See:** [Recognizing Dependency](recognizing-dependency.md)

### Keep It Healthy

**Check:**
- Am I the only support for someone? (Red flag)
- Am I burning out? (Need boundaries)
- Is help empowering or creating dependency?
- Is there reciprocity over time?
- Are boundaries respected?
