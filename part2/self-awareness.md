# Self-Awareness: When You Might Be Doing These Things Too

## We All Do Silly Stuff When We're Vulnerable

Nobody wants to think they're being manipulative, boundary-crossing, or overwhelming. And here's the truth: **we all do these things sometimes, especially when we're stressed, scared, or hurting.**

This isn't about being a bad person. It's about recognizing patterns so you can work on them.

**Remember:** Teachers are workers doing their jobs. Facilitators and TAs are volunteers giving their time. We're all just people trying our best, and we all mess up sometimes.

## Why Self-Awareness Matters

### Everyone Has Patterns

**We all:**
- Learned some unhealthy patterns somewhere (usually not our fault)
- Can cause harm even with good intentions
- Have blind spots
- Get messy when we're vulnerable
- Can grow and change

**The difference isn't whether you mess up - it's:**
- Do you recognize it when it's pointed out?
- Do you take accountability?
- Do you work to change it?

**This is what separates learning from harm.**

## Are You Leaning Too Hard on One Person?

### Check Yourself (With Kindness)

**When you're stressed or struggling, do you:**
- Rely on one person to meet most of your needs?
- Get really upset when that person isn't available?
- Feel like this one person is the only one who "gets" you?
- Message the same person (teacher, TA, facilitator, peer) constantly?
- Feel panicky when they don't respond right away?
- Resist using other resources because "it's not the same"?

**Do you notice:**
- That person seems tired when you interact?
- They're responding less or taking longer?
- They've started setting boundaries with you?
- Other people have said you're "a lot" for someone?

**If yes:** You might be building dependency. **This is really common when you're lonely, scared, or in crisis. It doesn't make you a bad person.**

**See:** [Recognizing Unhealthy Dependency](../part5/recognizing-unhealthy-dependency.md)

### What to Do About It

**Remember:** Teachers are workers with limited hours. Facilitators and TAs are volunteers with their own lives. They care, AND they can't be your everything.

1. **Notice it without shame** - "Oh, I'm doing this again"
2. **Diversify your support:**
   - Get a therapist (if possible)
   - Use crisis lines when you're in crisis
   - Join support groups
   - Build friendships with multiple people
   - Don't make one person responsible for your wellbeing
3. **Respect boundaries** - When someone says they're not available, believe them
4. **Work on the root issue** - What need are you trying to meet? How else could you meet it?

**You're not broken for needing support. You just need it from multiple places, not one person.**

## Are You Pushing When People Say No?

### Check Yourself (No Judgment)

**When someone sets a boundary, do you:**
- Keep asking "just this once"?
- Try to explain why you really need the exception?
- Feel hurt or angry that they won't make an exception for you?
- Test the boundary to see if they "really mean it"?
- Bring it up again later hoping they've changed their mind?
- Get upset and withdraw affection when they hold the line?

**Red flag phrases you might hear yourself saying:**
- "But I really need..."
- "You don't understand..."
- "I thought we were friends..."
- "If you cared, you would..."
- "You're being too strict..."

**If yes:** You're pushing boundaries. **This happens a lot when you're desperate or scared. It's a thing we all do. It's just not okay to keep doing it.**

**See:** [Boundary Violations & Love-Bombing](boundary-violations.md)

### What to Do About It

**Remember:** When a teacher, TA, or facilitator sets a boundary, they're not rejecting YOU - they're protecting their capacity to keep showing up (for you and everyone else).

1. **Stop immediately** when someone says no
2. **Take a breath** - Notice your feelings (hurt, anger, fear) without acting on them
3. **Apologize** - "I pushed after you set a boundary. I'm sorry."
4. **Respect it** - No more asking
5. **Look at why** - Are you afraid? Desperate? Feeling abandoned? (These feelings are real, even if the action wasn't okay)
6. **Get support** - Talk to someone else about those feelings

**A "no" doesn't mean you're bad. It means they have limits. We all do.**

## Are You Expecting More Than Is Reasonable?

### Check Yourself (Gently)

**Do you expect:**
- Teachers to respond immediately (they're workers with set hours)
- TAs or facilitators to be available 24/7 (they're volunteers with lives)
- Special treatment because your situation is harder (everyone's struggling)
- People to teach you for free when teaching is their job
- The community to revolve around your needs
- Accommodations without asking for them
- Everyone to understand your situation without explaining it?

**Entitled-sounding statements (we all say these sometimes):**
- "You should have..."
- "Why won't you just..."
- "It's not fair that..."
- "I deserve..."

**If yes:** You might be coming from a place of entitlement. **This often comes from fear, desperation, or past privilege. It's workable.**

### What to Do About It

**Reality check with compassion:**

1. **Teachers are workers** - They have set hours, they get paid for specific work, they're not available 24/7
2. **Facilitators and TAs are volunteers** - They're giving their time for free, they have full lives, they can say no anytime
3. **Nobody owes you anything** - Help is given freely, not owed
4. **Ask, don't demand** - "Could you help?" not "You should help"
5. **Respect "no"** - It's an answer, not a negotiation
6. **Get curious** - Where did you learn to expect this? What were you taught about what you deserve?

**It's okay to have needs. It's not okay to demand others meet them unconditionally.**

## Are You Using Vulnerability as a Tool?

### Check Yourself (With Self-Compassion)

**When you're hurting, do you:**
- Share your struggles to make people feel obligated to help?
- Mention self-harm when people set boundaries?
- Use your pain to guilt people into doing things?
- Make your crises other people's emergencies?
- Frame everything as life-or-death to get attention?
- Feel like crisis is the only way people will care?

**If yes:** You might be weaponizing vulnerability. **This is a learned survival strategy. It makes sense that you learned it. It's still causing harm.**

**See:** [Understanding Manipulation](../part1/understanding-manipulation.md)

### What to Do About It

**Be honest with yourself:**

1. **Recognize the pattern** - "I do this when I'm scared no one will care otherwise"
2. **Understand why** - Was crisis the only time you got attention growing up? Did you learn that being vulnerable = power?
3. **Get help** - A therapist can help you unlearn this pattern
4. **Find other ways to connect** - Practice asking for help without catastrophizing
5. **Respect that people may not trust you** - If you've done this repeatedly, people will be wary. That's fair.

**You can be vulnerable without using it as a weapon. It takes practice.**

## Are You Coming On Too Strong?

### Check Yourself (Kindly)

**Do you:**
- Tell new people they're "the only one who understands you"?
- Get really intense really fast with people?
- Put people on pedestals before you really know them?
- Give excessive praise, gifts, or declarations?
- Feel crushed when people don't reciprocate your intensity?
- Withdraw when people ask you to slow down?

**If yes:** You might be love-bombing. **This often comes from loneliness, attachment wounds, or fear of abandonment. It's really common. It's also overwhelming for others.**

**See:** [Boundary Violations & Love-Bombing](boundary-violations.md)

### What to Do About It

1. **Slow down** - Let relationships build naturally over time
2. **Notice the urge** - When you want to tell someone they're special after one conversation, pause
3. **Diversify connection** - Don't make one person your everything
4. **Work on attachment** - Therapy helps with this
5. **Be patient** - Real connection takes time

**You're not desperate or pathetic for wanting connection. You just need to pace it differently.**

## When Facilitators or Teachers Set Boundaries With You

### What's Actually Happening

**They're not:**
- Rejecting you as a person
- Being mean or uncaring
- Discriminating against you
- Giving up on you

**They're:**
- Protecting their capacity so they can keep showing up
- Being honest about their limits (which is kind)
- Modeling healthy relationships
- Caring enough to be real with you

**Remember:**
- **Teachers are workers** - They clock in and out, they have lives
- **Facilitators and TAs are volunteers** - They're giving their time for free, they don't owe you unlimited access

**When they say "I can't":** Believe them.

## Getting Help With Patterns

### These Things Are Workable

**If you notice yourself doing these patterns:**

1. **Be kind to yourself** - You learned this somewhere, probably when you were vulnerable
2. **Take it seriously** - Understanding why doesn't mean it's okay to keep doing
3. **Get support:**
   - **Therapy** - [findhelp.org](https://findhelp.org) can help you find free or low-cost options
   - **Support groups** - Many are free and peer-led
   - **Crisis lines when you're activated** - 988, Crisis Text Line (741741)
   - See [Mental Health Resources](../part3/mental-health-support.md) for more free options
4. **Practice new patterns:**
   - Ask for consent before venting
   - Respect boundaries the first time
   - Diversify your support
   - Slow down in relationships

**Finding Free/Low-Cost Help:**

## Self-Compassion AND Accountability

### You Can Hold Both

**You're not a terrible person for doing these things.**

**Everyone learns harmful behaviors somewhere:**
- Childhood survival strategies
- Past relationships
- Trauma responses
- Cultural conditioning
- Things that worked once but don't work now

**Understanding where it came from doesn't excuse continuing it.**

**You can:**
- Have compassion for yourself ("I learned this when I was surviving")
- Understand the root ("I do this when I'm scared")
- Take full accountability ("I'm doing this and it's affecting people")
- Work to change ("I'm going to get help with this pattern")

**All of these at once.**

---

## When You've Messed Up

### Repair Is Possible

**If you realize you've been doing one of these patterns:**

1. **Don't spiral** - This isn't "I'm a terrible person," it's "I did a thing I want to change"
2. **Acknowledge it** - To the person affected, if appropriate
3. **Apologize specifically** - "I kept pushing after you set a boundary. That wasn't okay. I'm sorry."
4. **Ask what they need** - Not what you think they need
5. **Actually change** - Get help if you need it
6. **Accept consequences** - They might not forgive you or want to continue the relationship. That's fair.

### They Don't Have to Forgive You

**Even if you:**
- Take accountability perfectly
- Apologize sincerely
- Change completely
- Do everything right

**They get to:**
- Not forgive you
- Keep the boundary
- End the relationship
- Protect themselves

**That's their right. It's not punishment. It's self-care.**

## Remember

**We ALL do silly stuff when we're vulnerable, scared, hurting, or desperate.**

**The question isn't "am I doing this?" (probably yes, sometimes)**

**The question is: "When I notice it or someone points it out, what do I do?"**

**Do I:**
- Get defensive and deny?
- OR recognize it and work on it?

**That's the difference.**

---

## You Can Change

**If you:**
- Notice the pattern (even if someone else points it out)
- Take accountability (without defensiveness)
- Get help (therapy, support groups, etc.)
- Actually work on it (not just promising)

**You can:**
- Build healthier relationships
- Stop overwhelming people
- Learn new patterns
- Repair some of the damage

**Change is hard. Change is possible.**

**You're not broken. You're learning.**
