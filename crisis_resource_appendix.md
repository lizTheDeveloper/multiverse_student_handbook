### **I. What to Say (Crisis Scripts)**

**Grounding Script (if they’re overwhelmed but not unsafe):**
> “It sounds like you’re going through a lot right now. I care about your wellbeing, but I’m not equipped to offer crisis support. Let’s make sure you have someone safe to talk to. Can I share some crisis and mental health resources with you?”

**Suicidal Ideation Script:**
> “I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. You deserve help right now. We’re not a crisis service, but there are people available 24/7 who can help you stay safe. Can I give you their contact info?”

**Delusional or Paranoid Behavior Script:**
> “That sounds really stressful. I can’t verify what’s happening, but it sounds like you could use someone to talk to in real life about your safety. Here are some trusted lines and resources where trained listeners can support you.”

**Aggression or Threat Script:**
> “We’re going to pause contact for safety. You’re not in trouble, but this space isn’t the right place for this conversation. Please reach out to a trusted friend or local support line.”

### **V. Teacher & Mod Guidance: How to Refer**

1. **Stay Grounded:** Use calm, short sentences.
2. **Offer Links and Numbers, Not Advice.**
   - You're a bridge, not a clinician.
3. **Stay With Them Until Connected (Unless Manipulation Is Clear)**
   - **General rule:** Don't leave someone in crisis alone. Stay in contact until they've connected to 988, a crisis line, or another crisis support resource.
   - **Exception:** If someone is clearly using threats of self-harm to emotionally manipulate (e.g., "If you don't do X, I'll hurt myself"), you can set a boundary and disengage after offering resources.
   - End supportively: "I care about your safety. Here are the resources. I'm going to step back now, but please reach out to 988 or [appropriate resource]."
4. **Document & Escalate.**
   - Note time, message, what resource you gave, and whether they connected to support.

**Quick Copy Block (for Chat or Email):**
> If you’re in crisis or need someone to talk to, please reach out to the 988 Lifeline (U.S.) or visit findahelpline.com for international options. You don’t have to handle this alone.

**Core Principle:**
> You are not abandoning them—you are connecting them to people who can actually help.
