# Liberatory Pedagogy Framework for The Multiverse School

## Our Theoretical Grounding

This handbook is rooted in liberatory education traditions that center **love, mutual aid, decolonization, and horizontal relationships**. We reject the "banking model" of education (where teachers deposit knowledge into passive students) and the pathologizing frameworks of institutional psychiatry in favor of practices that honor autonomy, interconnection, and collective liberation.

**Why this framework matters:**
- It shifts us from **hierarchy to relationality**
- It moves us from **pathology to healing**
- It centers **love as political practice**, not sentiment
- It grounds **boundaries in consent**, not authority
- It asks **"What healing do you need?"** not "What's wrong with you?"

## The Framework in Three Parts

### 1. [Foundational Thinkers](part7/liberatory-thinkers.md)

Learn about the thinkers and traditions that ground our approach:
- **Paulo Freire** — Education as the practice of freedom; banking model vs. problem-posing education
- **bell hooks** — Love as political practice; engaged pedagogy; boundaries as acts of love
- **Emma Goldman** — Mutual aid as anarchist practice; voluntary cooperation over coercion
- **Marshall Rosenberg** — Nonviolent Communication (NVC); observations, feelings, needs, requests
- **Indigenous Perspectives** — Relational accountability; healing-centered practice; decolonizing mental health

### 2. [Liberatory Practice: Applying the Framework](part7/liberatory-practice.md)

Practical guidance on applying these principles in The Multiverse School:
- **Language shifts** — From hierarchy/pathology to liberation/healing
- **Core principles reframed** — Co-learners not managers; boundaries as consensual; honoring different ways of being
- **Applying the framework** — When someone is struggling, when setting boundaries, when teaching, when responding to crisis
- **Questions for reflection** — Using NVC to navigate difficult situations
- **Honoring the tensions** — Love AND boundaries, horizontal relationships AND power differences

## Key Concepts Quick Reference

### Banking Model vs. Problem-Posing Education (Freire)
- **Banking:** Teacher knows all, students receive deposits
- **Problem-posing:** Co-investigation of reality, mutual learning

### Engaged Pedagogy (hooks)
- Teachers must be whole to teach
- Love is political practice, not sentiment
- Boundaries are acts of love

### Mutual Aid (Goldman, Kropotkin)
- Voluntary cooperation, not coercion
- Horizontal relationships, not hierarchy
- No saviors—we create community together

### Nonviolent Communication (Rosenberg)
- Observations, not evaluations
- Feelings and needs, not judgments
- Requests, not demands

### Relational Accountability (Indigenous frameworks)
- "All my relations"—we are interconnected
- Healing through connection, not isolation
- Community care, not individual pathology

### Healing-Centered Practice
- "What happened to you? What healing do you need?"
- Not "What's wrong with you?"

## Questions for Reflection

When facing a difficult situation, ask:

1. **Observation (NVC):** What am I actually observing, without judgment or evaluation?
2. **Needs (NVC):** What needs are not being met—for this person, for me, for the community?
3. **Power:** Who holds power here? How can we make it more horizontal?
4. **Pathology:** Are we pathologizing what oppression creates?
5. **Relationality:** How does this affect all our relations?
6. **Liberation:** Does this move us toward freedom or control?
7. **Love:** Are we daring to love deeply (which includes boundaries)?
8. **Collective:** How do we balance individual needs with collective wellbeing?

## In Practice

**In this handbook, we:**
- Name power instead of obscuring it
- Use healing/liberatory language instead of pathology
- Center relationality and collective wellbeing
- Acknowledge tensions instead of offering false certainties
- Ground boundaries in love and consent, not authority

**In our community, we:**
- Practice problem-posing, not banking model
- Facilitate healing, not diagnose and manage
- Build mutual aid, not charity
- Center decolonization and neurodivergence-affirmation
- Dare to love deeply while holding fierce boundaries

---

## This Is Living Practice

This framework is not dogma. It's a living practice we refine together through:
- Dialogue and reflection
- Learning from mistakes
- Accountability when we cause harm
- Celebrating when we get it right
- Trusting the collective wisdom

---

## Guiding Principle

> **Education is the practice of freedom. Love is political praxis. We liberate ourselves together, or not at all. Dare to love deeply—which means daring to be accountable, to set boundaries, to honor different ways of being, and to build toward collective liberation.**
