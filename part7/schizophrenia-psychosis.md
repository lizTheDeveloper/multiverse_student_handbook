# Understanding Schizophrenia & Psychosis in Educational Settings

## Critical Context First

### You Are Not a Diagnostician
This guide helps you recognize when someone may be experiencing psychosis and might need support. You cannot and should not diagnose schizophrenia or any psychotic disorder.

**From liberatory pedagogy:** We observe patterns (NVC), connect to needs, and facilitate access to healing resources—we don't pathologize or diagnose.

### Reducing Stigma & Honoring Mad Pride
Schizophrenia and psychosis are among the most stigmatized experiences, but:
- Most people with schizophrenia are **not violent** (they're far more likely to be victims than perpetrators)
- Many people with schizophrenia and psychotic experiences live full, meaningful lives
- Some people embrace "mad pride" and reject the medical model entirely
- Psychosis can be temporary, situational, or episodic
- First episode psychosis is highly responsive to support when intervention happens early
- Some frameworks view psychosis as a different way of experiencing reality, not inherently pathological

**Healing-centered perspective:** Psychosis can be understood as the mind's attempt to make sense of overwhelming experiences, trauma, or neurological differences. For some, it's a spiritual emergence. For others, it's a crisis requiring support. What matters: Is the person safe? Can they meet their needs? Are they able to participate in voluntary cooperation?

### What Psychosis Is
**Psychosis** is a state where someone loses touch with consensus reality. It can include:
- **Hallucinations:** Sensing things that aren't there (hearing voices, seeing things)
- **Delusions:** Fixed false beliefs (persecution, grandiosity, reference)
- **Disorganized thinking:** Trouble organizing thoughts or speech
- **Disorganized behavior:** Actions that don't make sense to others

**Psychosis is not the same as schizophrenia.** Many conditions can cause psychosis:
- Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
- Bipolar disorder (manic or depressive psychosis)
- Severe depression with psychotic features
- Substance use (especially cannabis, stimulants, psychedelics)
- Medical conditions (infections, autoimmune disorders, brain injuries)
- Extreme stress or trauma
- Sleep deprivation

## First Episode Psychosis in Young Adults

### Why This Matters for Adult Education
- **Peak onset:** Late teens to early 20s (prime college/learning age)
- **82% of college students with first episode psychosis take a leave of absence**
- **Schizophrenia is the most common reason students drop out of high school**
- **Early intervention improves outcomes dramatically**

**You may be the first person to notice someone is developing psychosis.** Your recognition and referral can be life-changing.

---

## Recognizing Early Warning Signs

### Prodromal Phase (Before Full Psychosis)
Students may show subtle changes weeks or months before obvious psychosis:

**Social Withdrawal:**
- Stops attending class or participating in chat
- Drops out of social activities
- Seems disconnected from peers

**Cognitive Changes:**
- Trouble concentrating or following discussions
- Work quality declines noticeably
- Seems confused or disorganized

**Perceptual Changes:**
- Mentions things seem "different" or "weird"
- Says colors are brighter, sounds are louder
- Reports sensing things others don't

**Mood & Behavior:**
- Increased anxiety or paranoia
- Depression or lack of motivation (avolition)
- Sleep disturbances
- Odd or inappropriate emotional responses

**Content of Speech:**
- Unusual preoccupations (conspiracy theories, persecution, special powers)
- Magical thinking beyond cultural norms
- Ideas of reference ("That billboard is sending me a message")

**Key:** Any one of these can be normal stress, neurodivergence, or other conditions. **It's the cluster and the change from baseline that matters.**

---

## Recognizing Active Psychosis

### What It May Look Like in Educational Settings

#### 1. Disorganized Communication
**Examples:**
- Speech becomes hard to follow (word salad, tangential)
- Messages don't make logical sense
- Seems to be responding to things you can't see/hear
- Starts many ideas but doesn't finish them

**Example message:**
> "The colors told me about the algorithm and you know how the birds work right? Seven is the key but they're watching through the cameras. Did you get my assignment it's about the frequency."

**Not psychosis:** Autistic communication differences, ADHD distractibility, or being a non-native English speaker. Psychosis involves a *change* in ability to communicate coherently.

---

#### 2. Paranoid or Persecutory Delusions
**Examples:**
- Believes they're being hacked, surveilled, or targeted (without evidence)
- Thinks other students or teachers are conspiring against them
- Believes government, corporations, or shadowy groups are after them specifically
- May involve authorities or make accusations

**Example:**
> "I know you and [student] are working together to get me kicked out. I've documented everything. I'm filing a report."

**Not psychosis:** Actually being targeted (verify first), trauma responses (hypervigilance from real past harm), or reasonable concerns about privacy. Psychosis involves beliefs that persist despite evidence to the contrary.

---

#### 3. Grandiose Delusions
**Examples:**
- Claims to have special powers or divine mission
- Believes they're a chosen one, prophet, or enlightened being
- Claims impossible abilities or knowledge
- May believe they can control reality, read minds, or communicate with higher beings

**Example:**
> "I've ascended to the fifth dimension. I can see the code underlying reality. I'm here to teach you all how to transcend, but most people aren't ready yet."

**Not psychosis:** Spiritual experiences within cultural context, metaphorical language, or neurodivergent intensity. Psychosis involves loss of insight (can't consider they might be wrong) and functional impairment.

**Overlap with mania:** See "When Vision Becomes Delusion" guide. Mania and psychosis can co-occur.

---

#### 4. Hallucinations
**Examples:**
- Mentions hearing voices commenting on them or commanding them
- Sees things others don't see
- Seems to be responding to stimuli that aren't there
- May pause mid-conversation as if listening to something

**Cues:**
- Pauses and seems distracted by internal stimuli
- Asks "Did you hear that?" when nothing happened
- Looks at or responds to things not present
- Reports voices that are distinct from their own thoughts

**Not psychosis:** Auditory processing differences (autistic people may process sound differently), tinnitus, or intrusive thoughts (OCD, anxiety). True hallucinations are perceived as external and real.

---

#### 5. Disorganized or Catatonic Behavior
**Examples:**
- Actions that don't make sense or serve a purpose
- Trouble with basic self-care (hygiene, eating, dressing)
- Extremely slowed movements or speech
- Staying in odd positions
- Repeating movements

**In online settings:**
- Messages become incoherent
- Stops responding entirely (catatonia)
- Posts become bizarre or nonsensical
- Stops attending to basic life tasks

---

## What to Do When You Observe Possible Psychosis

### Step 1: Stay Grounded, Honor Their Reality Without Confirming or Denying

**Don't:**
- Argue ("That's not real" or "You're being paranoid")
- Try to logic them out of their experience
- Confirm or validate delusions as objective reality

**Do (NVC-informed):**
- Acknowledge their distress without arguing about content
- Stay calm and grounded
- Express concern from observation: "I'm noticing [behavior] and I'm concerned about your wellbeing"

**What needs might be present:**
- **Their needs:** Safety, being heard, understanding, relief from distress
- **Your needs:** Safety for them and community, clarity about how to help
- **Community needs:** Safety, learning environment stability

**Script (NVC):**
> "I'm hearing that this feels very real and frightening for you. I can't verify what you're experiencing from my perspective, but I'm concerned about your wellbeing. Have you been in touch with a therapist, doctor, or support person recently?"

---

### Step 2: Assess Safety
**Ask directly:**
- "Are you safe right now?"
- "Are the voices telling you to hurt yourself or others?"
- "Do you have someone with you?"
- "When did you last sleep/eat?"

**If YES to harm:**
- Immediate escalation (988, crisis services, possibly 911)
- Don't try to manage alone
- Notify admin immediately

**If NO immediate danger but clearly psychotic:**
- Still escalate, but less urgently
- Encourage them to contact mental health services
- Notify admin

---

### Step 3: Provide Resources & Escalate

**Provide:**
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (trained for psychosis)
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
- Local psychiatric emergency services
- Encourage contacting family, therapist, or doctor

**For first episode psychosis:**
- **Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs** — Evidence-based early intervention
- **Strong 365** — Online support for first episode psychosis [strong365.org](https://strong365.org)
- **NAMI** — Education and support [nami.org](https://nami.org)
- **ISPS-US** — Non-medical approaches to psychosis [isps-us.org](https://isps-us.org)

**Script:**
> "I'm noticing some things that concern me about your wellbeing. I think it would be really helpful for you to talk to a mental health professional. Here are some resources: [list]. Have you been in touch with a therapist or doctor?"

---

### Step 4: Community Pause for Healing Support

**When active psychosis makes voluntary participation impossible:**

If someone is experiencing psychosis severe enough that they cannot engage with shared reality, meet their own basic needs, or participate in consensual communication, learning community cannot be safe or beneficial for anyone involved.

**This is not punishment—it's recognition that the person needs different support than a learning community can provide.**

**What needs are we honoring:**
- **Their need:** For crisis support, safety, healing resources designed for psychosis
- **Community need:** For learning environment where everyone can participate voluntarily and safely
- **Your need:** To facilitate learning, not provide crisis mental health support

**Script (relational accountability):**
> "I care about your wellbeing, and I'm observing [specific concerning behaviors/communications]. Right now, the support you need is beyond what this learning community can provide. I'm pausing your community participation so you can access crisis and healing resources. Please reach out to [crisis resources: 988, local psychiatric services]. When you're working with support services and able to participate voluntarily in shared learning space, we can discuss re-entry. This is about getting you the right kind of support."

---

### Step 5: Document & Notify
- Document exactly what you observed (quotes, behaviors, dates)
- Include what you said and what resources you provided
- Notify admin immediately
- Do not try to handle ongoing crisis alone

---

## Special Considerations

### Substance-Induced Psychosis
Cannabis, stimulants (Adderall, cocaine, meth), and psychedelics can all cause psychosis, especially in vulnerable individuals.

**Signs:**
- Recent increase in substance use mentioned
- Psychosis emerges suddenly (not gradual)
- May mention specific substances
- Other signs of intoxication

**Still requires clinical intervention.** Substance-induced psychosis can be dangerous and may reveal underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorders.

---

### Spiritual Emergency vs. Psychosis
Some spiritual experiences can look like psychosis but occur within a cultural/spiritual framework and don't cause loss of functioning.

**Spiritual experience (usually not psychosis):**
- Person maintains relationships, self-care, and functioning
- Can discuss the experience symbolically or metaphorically
- Grounded in a tradition or practice
- Maintains insight (can consider multiple perspectives)

**Psychotic episode:**
- Loss of functioning (not eating, sleeping, working)
- Can't consider they might be wrong
- Isolated from support systems
- Making dangerous decisions based on beliefs
- No cultural/spiritual container

**When in doubt, refer to mental health professional who can assess.**

### Autism, Trauma, & Psychosis
Some autistic traits can be mistaken for psychosis:
- Atypical speech patterns
- Unusual perceptual experiences (synesthesia, sensory sensitivities)
- Strong special interests that seem "odd"
- Social withdrawal

**Key differences:**
- Autistic traits are **lifelong and consistent**, not a sudden change
- Autistic people maintain logical thinking (even if their interests seem niche)
- No loss of reality testing (they know what's real vs. not real)

**Trauma can cause dissociation, hypervigilance, and flashbacks** that might seem like psychosis but are different.

**Some autistic people DO develop psychosis** — don't dismiss concerns just because someone is autistic.

## Supporting Students in Recovery

### If a Student Returns After Treatment
Many students with psychosis, including schizophrenia, return to education successfully with treatment.

**What helps:**
- Clear expectations and structure
- Patience with cognitive processing (may be slower)
- Accommodation for medication side effects (fatigue, cognitive slowing)
- Regular check-ins (brief, supportive)
- Reduce sensory overwhelm when possible
- Connection to peer support

**What doesn't help:**
- Treating them as fragile or "broken"
- Reducing all expectations
- Constantly asking "Are you okay?"
- Bringing up their psychotic episode repeatedly
- Stigmatizing language

**Accommodations to consider:**
- Extended deadlines if cognitive processing is affected
- Recorded lectures (if memory/attention impacted)
- Quiet break spaces
- Flexible attendance if medication side effects are challenging

---

## Evidence-Based Support: What Treatment Looks Like

### Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC)
- Most evidence-based approach for first episode psychosis
- Includes: medication, therapy, family support, education/employment support
- Improves mental health, reduces homelessness, improves education outcomes, reduces unemployment

### Medication
- Antipsychotics are primary treatment for schizophrenia
- Students may have side effects: fatigue, weight gain, cognitive slowing, dry mouth, tremors
- Never suggest someone stop or start medication

### Peer Support
- **Students With Psychosis (SWP)** — Global nonprofit for students (sws.ngo)
- **NAMI** — Family and peer support groups
- **Hearing Voices Network** — Peer support for people who hear voices

### Non-Medical Approaches
- **ISPS-US** (International Society for Psychological and Social Approaches to Psychosis)
- Open Dialogue, Soteria models
- Emphasize relationship, meaning-making, and recovery

---

## Self-Care for Teachers

Witnessing someone in psychosis can be **deeply unsettling**.

**You may feel:**
- Scared or unnerved
- Helpless or responsible
- Confused about what's real
- Grief for the student's struggle

**What helps:**
- Immediate debrief with admin or colleague
- Remember: you can't fix this, only refer
- Ground in your own reality (what is real for you)
- Take a break after the interaction
- Access your own support if needed

## Dismantling Stigma

### Common Myths About Schizophrenia

**Myth:** People with schizophrenia are violent.
**Reality:** They're more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Media dramatically overrepresents violence.

**Myth:** Schizophrenia means "split personality."
**Reality:** That's Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), a completely different condition. Schizophrenia means "split from reality" (psychosis).

**Myth:** People with schizophrenia can't function or work.
**Reality:** Many people with schizophrenia lead fulfilling lives with treatment, including education and careers.

**Myth:** Schizophrenia is caused by bad parenting.
**Reality:** It's a brain-based condition with genetic, neurological, and environmental factors.

## Psychiatric Survivor Perspectives & Mad Pride

### Alternative Frameworks for Understanding Psychosis

**Medical model:** Psychosis is a brain disease requiring pharmaceutical treatment.

**Mad Pride / Psychiatric Survivor model:** Psychosis can be:
- A meaningful response to trauma or oppressive conditions
- A spiritual or transformative experience
- A different way of perceiving reality that doesn't require "curing"
- Often exacerbated by force, coercion, and psychiatric violence

**What this means for you:**
- Some people who experience psychosis reject the medical model entirely
- Peer support, Open Dialogue, Soteria Houses, and trauma therapy are valid alternatives to traditional psychiatry
- Forced treatment (involuntary hospitalization, forced medication) can be traumatic and should be last resort
- Listen to how the person frames their own experience—don't impose medical language if they reject it

**Resources:**
- **Mad in America:** [madinamerica.com](https://madinamerica.com) — Critical psychiatry perspectives
- **The Icarus Project (now Fireweed Collective):** [fireweedcollective.org](https://fireweedcollective.org) — Peer support, mutual aid approach to extreme states
- **Will Hall's Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs:** [fireweedcollective.org/crisis-toolkit/](https://fireweedcollective.org/crisis-toolkit/)
- **Hearing Voices Network:** [hearing-voices.org](https://hearing-voices.org) — Peer support without requiring medical framework

### When Voluntary Support Isn't Enough

**We strongly prefer voluntary, peer-led, and trauma-informed approaches.** However:

If someone is:
- In imminent danger to self or others
- Unable to meet basic survival needs (food, shelter, safety)
- Experiencing psychosis so severe they cannot consent to or refuse help

Then involuntary intervention may become necessary—but this should be a last resort after all voluntary options have been exhausted, and should be done with as much dignity and agency-preservation as possible.

## Key Principles (Liberatory Framework)

1. **Observe, don't diagnose (NVC)** — You recognize concerning patterns, not disorders
2. **Honor multiple frameworks** — Medical model, mad pride, spiritual emergence—listen to how the person understands their experience
3. **Early connection to support can be life-saving** — Recognize patterns and facilitate access to resources (medical or peer-based)
4. **You can't argue someone out of psychosis** — Stay grounded, don't argue with content of delusions, refer to appropriate support
5. **Safety first, voluntary support when possible** — Assess for harm, escalate as needed, prefer voluntary approaches
6. **Reduce stigma, honor mad pride** — Use language the person prefers (person-first, identity-first, or Mad pride terms)
7. **Recovery and thriving are possible** — Many people live full lives with or beyond psychosis
8. **You're a facilitator, not a clinician** — Connect to resources, don't treat or diagnose
9. **Self-care is necessary** — Witnessing psychosis affects you; tend yourself to tend community

---

## Quick Reference: Is This Psychosis?

**Possible psychosis if:**
- Believes things that are clearly not true, despite evidence
- Hearing, seeing, or sensing things others don't
- Speech becomes incoherent or hard to follow
- Behavior doesn't make sense or serve a purpose
- Loss of basic functioning (hygiene, eating, sleeping)
- **AND it's a change from their baseline**

**Probably not psychosis if:**
- Cultural or spiritual beliefs within their community's norms
- Consistent with their lifelong neurodivergent traits
- Metaphorical or artistic expression
- They can discuss it from multiple perspectives
- Maintains functioning and relationships

**When in doubt:** Refer to mental health professional. Better to over-refer than miss a crisis.

## Remember

**Psychosis can be terrifying, meaningful, spiritual, or some combination.** Whatever the person is experiencing, your grounded, non-judgmental presence and facilitation of appropriate resources (medical, peer-based, or both) can be transformative.

**From healing-centered practice:** Psychosis is not inherently pathological—it's a different state of consciousness that sometimes signals crisis and sometimes signals emergence. What matters: safety, consent, access to support the person chooses.

**From liberatory pedagogy:** You cannot rescue someone experiencing psychosis. You can observe with compassion (NVC), connect them to resources that honor their autonomy, and hold space for them to access healing on their own terms—while maintaining boundaries that protect collective safety.

> **Guiding principle:** Observe patterns with compassion. Honor their framework for understanding their experience. Facilitate access to resources (medical, peer, spiritual, or all three). Maintain safety without coercion when possible. You are a bridge to support, not a clinician or savior.
