# Marshall Rosenberg: Nonviolent Communication as Liberatory Practice

Marshall Rosenberg (1934-2015) developed Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a framework for compassionate connection that's been used in conflict resolution, education, therapy, and peacebuilding worldwide. His work gives us practical language tools for the liberatory principles of the other frameworks.

## The Core Framework: Four Components of NVC

NVC provides a structure for expressing ourselves and listening to others in ways that create connection rather than defensiveness.

### Component 1: Observations (Not Evaluations)

An observation is what you see or hear, free of judgment. An evaluation is your interpretation or diagnosis of what you observe.

The difference matters because evaluations trigger defensiveness while observations create openness. When you say "You're being manipulative," the other person hears an attack on their character. When you say "When I notice you asking for support immediately after I've said I need rest," they hear data they can consider.

**The observation practice:** Before speaking, ask yourself: Am I describing what happened, or am I judging what happened? Can the other person agree with my observation even if they interpret it differently?

**Examples:**
- Evaluation: "You interrupt all the time" → Observation: "In our last meeting, I was mid-sentence three times when you started speaking"
- Evaluation: "You're lazy" → Observation: "The project deadline passed yesterday without submission"
- Evaluation: "This student is manipulative" → Observation: "When I set a boundary, I receive multiple messages expressing distress"

### Component 2: Feelings (Not Thoughts)

A feeling is an emotion in your body. A thought is what you think about a situation, often disguised as a feeling.

"I feel like you don't care" is not a feeling—it's a thought about the other person's motives. "I feel hurt" or "I feel scared" are feelings—bodily sensations you can locate and name.

Rosenberg's key insight: When we say "you made me feel X," we give away our power. Our feelings come from whether our needs are met, not from what others do. What others do is the stimulus; our unmet need is the cause of our feeling.

**The feeling practice:** Notice the sensation in your body. Where do you feel it? What would you call it? Avoid "I feel that..." or "I feel like..." which usually introduce thoughts, not feelings.

**Examples:**
- Thought: "I feel like you're ignoring me" → Feeling: "I feel lonely and disconnected"
- Thought: "I feel manipulated" → Feeling: "I feel anxious and distrustful"
- Thought: "I feel that this is unfair" → Feeling: "I feel frustrated and disappointed"

### Component 3: Needs (Universal, Not Strategies)

A need is a universal human requirement. A strategy is a specific way to meet a need. Conflict is almost always about strategies, not needs—because at the level of needs, we can usually agree.

Every human needs safety, autonomy, understanding, contribution, rest, connection. We disagree about how to meet these needs (strategies), but we share the needs themselves.

**The need practice:** When you're upset, ask: What need of mine isn't being met? Not "what should they do?" but "what do I need?" Name the need (safety, respect, autonomy), not the strategy (you should apologize, everyone should follow rules).

**Examples:**
- Strategy: "I need you to stop talking" → Need: "I need to be heard" or "I need rest"
- Strategy: "I need you to apologize" → Need: "I need acknowledgment of impact"
- Strategy: "I need everyone to follow the rules" → Need: "I need safety and predictability"

### Component 4: Requests (Not Demands)

A request can be declined without negative consequences. A demand cannot be declined without punishment or guilt.

The same words can be a request or a demand depending on how you respond to "no." If someone says no and you punish them, guilt them, or threaten consequences, it was a demand. If someone says no and you accept that and look for another strategy to meet your need, it was a request.

**The request practice:** Make your request concrete, doable, in the present or near future, and in positive language (what you want, not what you don't want). Then genuinely allow for "no."

**Examples of clear requests:**
- Vague: "Be more respectful" → Concrete: "Would you be willing to wait until I finish speaking before responding?"
- Future-tense: "Don't be late again" → Present: "Could we agree to a check-in time of 3pm today?"
- Demand: "You have to fix this" → Request: "Would you be willing to meet with me to discuss how we can address this?"

## The NVC Formula

**Expressing yourself:**
"When I see/hear [observation], I feel [feeling] because I need [need]. Would you be willing to [request]?"

**Empathic listening:**
"Are you feeling [feeling] because you need [need]?"

**Example in context:**
"When I notice that project deadlines have been missed three times this month [observation], I feel anxious and concerned [feeling] because I need reliability and trust that our agreements are meaningful [needs]. Would you be willing to talk with me about what's making it hard to meet deadlines and what support might help? [request]"

## Empathy Before Education

Rosenberg taught that when someone is in pain, they can't hear you until they feel heard.

### The Empathy-First Framework

You may desperately want to explain yourself, defend your position, or solve the problem. Resist. First, connect to what the other person is feeling and needing. Only after they feel understood can they hear you or problem-solve.

**In practice:** When someone is upset:

**Don't:**
- Explain or defend yourself immediately
- Jump to solutions
- Try to calm them down
- Dismiss their feelings

**Do:**
- Listen for the feelings under their words
- Guess at the needs driving those feelings
- Reflect back what you hear
- Stay with them until they feel understood

**Script:**
Student (angry): "You don't care about us! You just want us to follow your stupid rules!"

Unhelpful: "That's not true, I care a lot!" (defending yourself)

NVC: "Are you feeling frustrated because you need to know that your wellbeing matters more than compliance?" (empathy, guessing at feelings and needs)

After they feel heard, THEN you can share your perspective or problem-solve.

## Self-Empathy: The Foundation

Before you can offer empathy to others, you need self-empathy—connecting to your own feelings and needs with compassion.

### The Self-Empathy Practice

When you're triggered, upset, or reactive, pause. Don't act yet. First, give yourself empathy.

**Ask:**
- What am I feeling? (Locate it in your body, name it)
- What need of mine isn't being met?
- Can I give myself compassion for having this need?

**Not self-empathy:**
- "I'm so stupid for feeling this way"
- "I shouldn't be upset"
- "Suck it up"

**Self-empathy:**
- "I'm feeling scared because I need safety"
- "I'm feeling frustrated because I need to matter"
- "I'm overwhelmed because I need rest and support"

When you acknowledge your own needs, you can choose how to respond rather than reacting from unmet needs.

## Jackal vs. Giraffe: Violent and Nonviolent Communication

Rosenberg used puppets to teach: Jackal (violent communication) and Giraffe (nonviolent communication, with its long neck to see far and large heart).

### Jackal Language

Jackal speaks in judgments, blame, labels, demands, right/wrong thinking. "You're being manipulative." "You always interrupt." "You have to stop."

Jackal language creates defensiveness, disconnection, power struggles.

### Giraffe Language

Giraffe speaks in observations, feelings, needs, requests. "When I notice X, I feel Y because I need Z. Would you be willing to...?"

Giraffe language creates connection, understanding, collaborative problem-solving.

### Translating Jackal to Giraffe

When you notice yourself in jackal mode, pause and translate:

Jackal: "You're so selfish!"
Giraffe: "When I see you using shared resources without checking with others [observation], I feel frustrated [feeling] because I need consideration and equity [needs]. Would you be willing to check in with the group before using shared resources? [request]"

You'll mess up. You'll go jackal. Notice it, translate to giraffe, repair if needed.

## Protective vs. Punitive Force

Rosenberg distinguished between force used to protect and force used to punish.

### Punitive Force

Punitive force is intended to cause suffering so the person will regret their action. It's coercion through pain. "You violated the rule, so now you suffer."

Punitive force creates resentment, rebellion, or submission—not understanding or growth.

### Protective Force

Protective force is intended to prevent harm, not to cause suffering. It's a last resort when dialogue isn't possible in the moment.

**Example:** If someone is actively harming another person and won't stop, you physically intervene to stop the harm. Your intention isn't to make them suffer, but to protect.

**In education:** Sometimes you need to remove someone from a learning space to protect the collective. This isn't punishment—it's protective. You're not trying to make them feel bad; you're preventing ongoing harm. When safety is restored, dialogue can happen.

## Applying NVC in The Multiverse

### Shift 1: From Diagnosis to Observation

Old model: "This student is manipulative" / "They have BPD" / "They're attention-seeking"

NVC: "When I observe [specific behavior pattern], I feel concerned because our community needs safety/trust/accessibility. I'm curious about what needs aren't being met."

See all mental health sections in handbook—they use observation language, not diagnosis.

### Shift 2: From Judgment to Needs

Old model: "You're being disrespectful" / "This is unacceptable" / "You're violating norms"

NVC: "When [observation of specific behavior], the impact I notice is [how it affects community]. I'm concerned because I value [need: accessibility, safety, trust]. Can we talk about this?"

### Shift 3: From Demands to Requests

Old model: "Stop doing that or you're out" / "You have to apologize"

NVC: "I need [need]. I'm requesting [concrete action]. Are you willing to work with me on this? If not, we may need to find a different path."

### Shift 4: Connecting to Universal Needs

In conflict, move from arguing about strategies to connecting at the level of needs.

Not: "You should do X" vs. "No, we should do Y" (arguing about strategies)

But: "We both need safety. We both need autonomy. How can we find a strategy that meets both needs?" (connecting to shared needs)

## Practical Tools

**The Four-Component Check:**
Before a difficult conversation, prepare using the four components:
- What did I observe? (concrete, specific)
- What am I feeling? (emotion in my body)
- What need of mine isn't met? (universal need)
- What am I requesting? (concrete, doable, positive)

**The Empathy First Reminder:**
When someone is upset, put a mental sticky note: "Empathy first, then problem-solving." Resist the urge to explain, defend, or fix until they feel heard.

**The Self-Empathy Pause:**
When triggered, pause. Place hand on heart. Ask: "What am I feeling? What do I need?" Give yourself compassion before responding.

**The Universal Needs List:**
Keep Rosenberg's list of universal needs handy. When upset, scan it to name what need isn't met. (Autonomy, safety, understanding, contribution, rest, connection, meaning, celebration, etc.)

## Key Quotes

"NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish."

"All violence is a tragic expression of unmet needs."

"When we give from the heart, we do so because of the joy that springs forth from an act of giving."

"Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are experiencing."

---

## Limitations

NVC can feel formulaic or robotic when first learning. It requires both parties to engage (doesn't work with someone determined to cause harm). It was developed in Western individualist context. It can be misused to tone-police marginalized people. It takes time (not always available in crisis).

We use the spirit of NVC, not rigid formula. We integrate it with Freire (collective liberation), hooks (love as political practice), Goldman (mutual aid), and Indigenous (relational accountability).
