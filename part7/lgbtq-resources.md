## Finding LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy

### What "Affirming" Means

**LGBTQ+-affirming therapy:**
- ✅ Your identity is valid, not pathology
- ✅ Therapist understands LGBTQ+ experiences
- ✅ No conversion therapy or "fixing"
- ✅ Addresses minority stress, discrimination, coming out
- ✅ Celebrates your identity

**NOT affirming:**
- ❌ Treats being LGBTQ+ as a problem
- ❌ Suggests you "work on" your identity
- ❌ Conversion therapy (illegal in many states, harmful everywhere)
- ❌ Ignorance about LGBTQ+ issues
- ❌ Misgendering, deadnaming

### Finding Therapists

4. **"Do you understand gender dysphoria / coming out / [your specific need]?"**

## Coming Out Resources

### Before You Come Out

**Ask yourself:**
1. Am I financially independent? (if not, have a safety plan)
2. Am I physically safe? (do you live with people who might react violently?)
3. Do I have support outside this person/group?
4. What's the worst-case scenario? Can I handle it?

**Coming out is not required.** You decide who knows, when, and how.
