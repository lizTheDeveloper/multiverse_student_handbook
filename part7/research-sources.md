# Research Sources & Evidence Base

This handbook is grounded in neurodivergent-led research, participatory frameworks, and evidence-based practices developed by and for the neurodivergent community.

## Neurodivergent-Led Research & Organizations

### AASPIRE (Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education)
**Website:** [aaspire.org](https://aaspire.org/)

AASPIRE is an international partnership that brings together academic researchers, autistic adults, family members, disability services providers, and healthcare providers to conduct research relevant to the needs of adults on the autism spectrum. Since 2006, they have adhered to principles of Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR), where academics and community members share power as equal partners.

**Key Research Areas:**
- **Autistic Burnout:** Characterized as a syndrome resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports, featuring pervasive long-term (3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus
- **Suicide Prevention:** Multi-level research examining individual, community, and policy factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among autistic individuals
- **Healthcare Access:** Development of the AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit to improve healthcare quality for autistic adults

**Key Finding:** The wellbeing of neurodivergent individuals depends on perceived levels of support and acceptance from peers and family members, not on the reduction of neurodivergent symptoms.

### Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network (AWN)
**Website:** [awnnetwork.org](https://awnnetwork.org/)

AWN has developed guiding principles for incorporating transformative and restorative justice into neurodiversity work.

**Key Frameworks:**

**Restorative Justice:** Focuses on restoring or repairing relationships after someone has caused harm or a rupture in the relationship.

**Transformative Justice:** Responds effectively to harm while also transforming the conditions that created the harm in the first place, preventing recurrence.

**Community Accountability:** Communities must support people who have caused harm to take accountability, grow, and transform. Accountability is an ongoing process necessary for building stronger relationships and community care.

### 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline - Neurodivergent Resources
**Website:** [988lifeline.org/neurodivergence resources](https://988lifeline.org/help-yourself/individuals-with-neurodivergence/)

The 988 Lifeline has developed specific resources for crisis center workers to identify and support autistic callers/texters in crisis.

**Key Insights:**
- Warning signs of imminent suicidal behavior in the general public do not represent the unique needs of the autism community
- Autistic individuals may not disclose their diagnosis but still need individualized, specific support
- Resources address unique differences in communication, thought processes, sensory issues, and potential misunderstandings

**Critical Context:** Autistic people are significantly more likely to suffer from major mental disorders and alarmingly more likely to die by suicide compared to the general population. Clinical evidence suggests autistic mental health correlates with autism acceptance and perceived quality of support, not primarily with symptom severity.

## Recent Research (2024-2025)

### Neurodivergent Peer Support Toolkit (NEST)
**Citation:** Crompton, C.J., Fotheringham, F., Cebula, K., Webber, C., Foley, S., & Fletcher-Watson, S. (2024). Neurodivergent-designed and neurodivergent-led peer support in school. *Autism & Developmental Language Impairments*.

**Key Findings:**
- First study to examine school-based support between neurodivergent peers (rather than pairing with neurotypical peers)
- Students found that NEST groups provided safe spaces for friendships and activities
- Participants could learn about neurodiversity and explore feelings about their own neurodivergence
- Identity-affirming peer support shows positive mental health outcomes

### Supports for Neurodivergent Students in Higher Education
**Citation:** McDowall, A., & Kiseleva, M. (2024). A rapid review of supports for neurodivergent students in higher education. *Journal of Educational Research*.

**Evidence-Based Supports:**
- **Examination adjustments**
- **Explicit instruction and strategy instruction**
- **Technology-based interventions**
- **Psychological supports**
- **Mentoring and coaching**
- **Comprehensive support programmes**
- **Transitions support** into university and employment

**Critical Principle:** Develop adjustments in collaboration with neurodivergent individuals, rather than assuming what they might need, keeping in mind the social model of disability.

### Peer Support Services Across Crisis Continuum
**Citation:** SAMHSA (2024). Peer Support Services Across the Crisis Continuum.

**Findings:**
- Significant shortages of peer support workers in crisis services nationwide
- 17 states lack peer support in call centers
- 24 states lack peer support in mobile crisis teams
- 23 states lack peer support in crisis stabilization units

**Implication:** Peer-led crisis support is evidence-based but underutilized.

## Neurodiversity-Affirming Frameworks

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
**Key Principles:**
- Provide structure, clear instructions, and course management
- Assignment scaffolding with concrete deadlines
- Labeled flexibility (when and why flexibility is offered)
- Multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression

---

### Neurodiversity 2.0 Framework
Integrates insights from disability studies, social justice, and policy, advocating for:
- Proactive, flexible, and participatory systems
- Centering both access and agency
- Application across research, education, employment, and healthcare

---

### Cognitive Load Framework for Online Learning
**Six Critical Areas Impacting Neurodivergent Learners:**
1. Format
2. Environment
3. Delivery
4. Instruction
5. Support
6. Research

## Best Practices from Research

### Executive Function Support
Executive function is the ability to organize, plan, and execute daily tasks while managing future tasks. Expected to become a standard employee/student benefit by 2025.

### Sensory Accommodations
- Noise-canceling headphones
- Designated quiet areas or times
- Softer lighting to supplement fluorescent lights
- Calm corners with soft furniture (bean bags, etc.) as sensory refuges

### Masking & Authenticity
Managers and educators should discuss masking techniques with neurodivergent individuals and assure them they don't need to mask in the learning/work environment. This allows better concentration and function.

### Professional Development
Ongoing training for educators should include:
- Neurodiversity awareness
- Inclusive teaching practices
- Specific accommodations and strategies
- Training developed by neurodivergent educators

## Core Ethical Principles

### From Disability Justice Movement:
1. **Nothing About Us Without Us** - Neurodivergent people must be leaders in all policies affecting them
2. **Social Model of Disability** - Disability is created by environmental barriers, not by individual impairment
3. **Presumption of Competence** - Assume neurodivergent people can learn, grow, and meet expectations
4. **Community Care Over Individual Cure** - Focus on creating supportive environments, not "fixing" individuals

### From Transformative Justice:
1. **Accountability as Process** - Accountability is ongoing, not a single event
2. **Harm Reduction** - Reduce harm while addressing root causes
3. **Community Responsibility** - The community shares responsibility for addressing harm
4. **Transformation Over Punishment** - Change conditions that enabled harm, don't just punish individuals

## What This Means for The Multiverse School

Our handbook prioritizes:
- **Neurodivergent-led frameworks** over clinical/deficit models
- **Peer support and community care** over individual pathologizing
- **Transformative justice** over punitive responses
- **Evidence-based accommodations** designed with neurodivergent input
- **Acceptance and support** as the primary drivers of wellbeing
