# bell hooks: Love as Political Practice

bell hooks (1952-2021) transformed how we understand teaching, love, and liberation. She extended Paulo Freire's work while bringing feminist, Black, and working-class Southern perspectives. Her framework centers love as political action and insists that teachers must be whole to teach.

**Essential reading:** *Teaching to Transgress* (1994), *All About Love* (2000)

## The Core Framework: Engaged Pedagogy

hooks calls her approach "engaged pedagogy"—teaching that respects and cares for the souls of students. This isn't sentiment. It's a rigorous practice that requires the teacher's own wellbeing and wholeness.

### The Teacher's Wholeness Comes First

You cannot teach from an empty well. hooks is explicit: "Engaged pedagogy does not seek simply to empower students. Any classroom that employs a holistic model of learning will also be a place where teachers grow, and are empowered by the process."

If you're burned out, depleted, or running on fumes, you can't create conditions where learning deeply occurs. Teaching requires passion, aliveness, presence—and you can't access these while ignoring your own needs.

**In practice:** Your boundaries, rest, therapy, spiritual practice, and self-care are not optional luxuries. They're essential infrastructure for sustainable teaching. When you set a boundary to protect your capacity, you're not being selfish—you're maintaining your ability to show up well.

## Love as Action, Not Feeling

hooks defines love precisely: "Love is as love does. Love is an act of will—namely, both an intention and an action."

Love is not warm feelings or being nice. Love is the combination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust. It's the will to extend yourself for someone's growth—including confronting them when they cause harm.

### The Love Framework

**Love requires all six elements:**

**Care:** Active concern for wellbeing. You pay attention to what's happening with students.

**Commitment:** Sustained engagement, not abandonment when things get hard. You don't disappear when someone struggles.

**Knowledge:** Understanding the person and situation. You don't make assumptions—you investigate and listen.

**Responsibility:** Accountability for your actions and their impact. When you harm someone, you acknowledge and repair.

**Respect:** Honoring autonomy and capacity. You don't try to control or manage—you support self-determination.

**Trust:** Faith in capacity for growth. You believe people can change and transform.

**Missing any element, it's not love.** If you have care and commitment but no respect (you try to control them "for their own good"), that's not love. If you have respect and care but no responsibility (you won't acknowledge your impact), that's not love.

## Boundaries as Acts of Love

One of hooks' most crucial teachings for educators: love includes confrontation and boundaries.

> "When we love we are able to be courageous enough to confront harsh truths. We can speak from the heart and share words that are confrontational and even critical. Love allows us to speak with care and to not be punitive, to be compassionate and empathetic."

### The Boundary-Love Integration

When you set a boundary—"I can't respond to messages after 8pm" or "This behavior harms community and can't continue"—you're practicing love. You're protecting collective wellbeing (care, responsibility) while respecting everyone's autonomy (respect, trust that the person can choose different behavior).

Avoiding confrontation isn't loving. It's avoiding discomfort at the expense of truth-telling. When someone harms others and you say nothing, you're not loving them—you're enabling harm and abandoning the people they hurt.

**The framework for loving confrontation:**
1. Connect to care: You're doing this because you value the person and community
2. Speak from the heart, not to punish: Your intention is growth, not shame
3. Be specific about impact: Describe what you observe and how it affects others
4. Honor autonomy: They choose how to respond
5. Hold the boundary with compassion: If they can't participate in the agreement, a different path is needed

**Example:**
"I care about you and this community. I'm noticing [specific pattern]. This impacts others by [specific harm]. I believe you can participate differently. Can you work with me on this? If not, we need to find a different path that keeps everyone safe."

## Eros in Teaching: Aliveness and Passion

hooks reclaims eros—not sexual energy, but life force, passion, aliveness—in teaching.

### The Aliveness Framework

Teaching that lacks eros is deadening. When you go through the motions, when learning feels rote and disconnected, when there's no excitement or passion, students learn that education is something to endure, not something that enlarges life.

Eros means bringing your full self—enthusiasm, curiosity, vulnerability, passion—to teaching. When you're genuinely excited about what you're teaching, that excitement is contagious. When you're curious and learning alongside students, that models that learning is a lifelong practice of freedom.

**What cultivates eros:**
- Teaching what you actually care about (not just what you "should" teach)
- Vulnerability and authenticity (sharing your own learning journey)
- Connecting subject matter to real life and real questions
- Creating space for surprise and emergence
- Integrating body, emotion, and spirit (not just intellect)

**What kills eros:**
- Treating teaching as mere information transfer
- Hiding your personality and passion
- Boring yourself (if you're bored, they're bored)
- Disconnection from why this matters
- Pretending to be neutral or "objective"

## Talking Back: Voice and Agency

From *Talking Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking Black*, hooks teaches that "talking back" means speaking as an equal, refusing to be silenced, claiming voice and agency.

### The Voice Framework

In oppressive contexts, talking back is resistance. Children are taught not to question authority. Marginalized people are told to be grateful and compliant. Students are trained to receive knowledge, not challenge it.

Liberatory education encourages talking back. You want students to question you, to challenge assumptions, to speak their truth. This isn't disrespect—it's critical thinking.

**In practice:**
- Welcome disagreement: "I appreciate you pushing back on that"
- Make space for questioning: "What doesn't sit right with you about this?"
- Model talking back: Share when you've questioned authority or challenged conventional wisdom
- Don't conflate respect with compliance: Respect means engagement, not agreement

When a student "talks back," ask yourself: Are they being disrespectful, or are they thinking critically and expressing it directly? Often what we label "disrespect" is actually someone refusing to be passive.

## The Wholeness Requirement

Engaged pedagogy requires that you bring your whole self and honor students' whole selves.

### Integration: Mind, Body, Spirit

Western education treats people as disembodied minds. You're supposed to sit still, suppress emotions, ignore your body, and think rationally. This is violence.

hooks insists on integration: mind, body, spirit are inseparable. Learning happens through all of you—intellectual understanding, emotional resonance, embodied experience, spiritual meaning-making.

**In practice:**
- Notice when you're suppressing emotions or bodily experience
- Create space for movement, emotional expression, spiritual connection
- Don't treat crying or anger as problems to manage
- Honor different ways of processing (some people need to move, some need silence, some need to talk)
- Connect learning to students' actual lives (not just abstract concepts)

## Solitude and Love: The Foundation

From *All About Love*: "Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving. When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape."

### The Solitude-Love Framework

If you can't tolerate being alone with yourself, you'll use relationships to escape yourself. You'll need students to validate you, like you, see you as a good teacher. This creates codependence, not community.

When you can be alone—when your worth doesn't depend on students' responses—you can love them freely. You can set boundaries without fear of abandonment. You can confront harm without fear of losing approval. You're present because you choose to be, not because you need them.

**Self-check questions:**
- Do I need students to like me?
- Do I get defensive when challenged?
- Am I devastated when someone leaves the community?
- Do I sacrifice my wellbeing to avoid disappointing students?
- Do I need to be needed?

If yes to these, you may be using teaching to escape solitude. The work is to develop your capacity to be alone, to find your worth independent of student outcomes.

## Building Community in the Classroom

hooks emphasizes that learning happens in community, and community requires commitment.

### The Community-Building Framework

Community isn't automatic. It's built through:

**Shared commitment to the work:** Everyone agrees to show up, engage, grow together.

**Recognition of everyone's presence:** Each person matters. No one is invisible or disposable.

**Willingness to be transformed:** You don't come to community to stay the same.

**Conflict as part of growth:** Differences will emerge. We learn to be in conflict together.

**Collective accountability:** We hold each other and ourselves accountable for our agreements.

**In practice:**
- Start courses/cohorts by building community agreements together
- Notice who speaks and who doesn't; create space for all voices
- Name when conflict arises; don't avoid it
- Celebrate growth and transformation when it happens
- Return to agreements when someone violates them

## White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy: Naming the System

hooks uses this phrase to name the interlocking system of domination. You can't pretend education is neutral about oppression.

### The Political Clarity Framework

Education either reproduces domination or challenges it. When you avoid talking about racism, sexism, ableism, capitalism, you're reproducing them through silence.

**In practice:**
- Name oppression when it shows up in the learning space
- Don't expect marginalized students to educate others about their oppression
- Center voices from the margins
- Challenge assumptions rooted in domination
- Make the political stakes of your work explicit

hooks is clear: you can't teach freedom while pretending white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy don't exist.

## Applying hooks' Framework in The Multiverse

### Shift 1: Your Wholeness Enables Your Teaching

Old model: Sacrifice yourself for students. Ignore your needs. Pour from an empty cup.

hooks' model: Tend your spirit. Set boundaries. Seek therapy, rest, community. Your wholeness is essential infrastructure.

### Shift 2: Boundaries Protect Love

Old model: "If I set a boundary, I'm not being loving."

hooks' model: "Boundaries are acts of love. They protect collective wellbeing. I can say 'this behavior harms community' because I care."

### Shift 3: Confrontation Is Care

Old model: Avoid conflict. Be nice. Don't upset people.

hooks' model: "When I love, I'm courageous enough to confront harsh truths. I speak with care, not to punish. Truth-telling is love."

### Shift 4: Passion and Aliveness Matter

Old model: Teaching is professional, neutral, detached.

hooks' model: Bring eros. Be excited. Be vulnerable. Show up fully. Learning should feel alive.

## Practical Tools

**The Six Elements of Love Audit:**
Before a difficult conversation, check: Am I bringing care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust? If any is missing, that's what needs attention first.

**The Loving Confrontation Script:**
"I care about you and this community [care]. I'm committed to working through this [commitment]. Here's what I'm observing [knowledge]. I'm accountable for my part [responsibility]. I trust you can hear this [trust and respect]. Can we talk about [specific behavior/impact]?"

**The Eros Check:**
Before teaching anything, ask: Do I actually care about this? If not, why am I teaching it? Can I find what matters to me in this material? If you can't find your passion, you're doing banking education.

**The Wholeness Inventory:**
Weekly: How am I tending mind, body, spirit? What needs attention? What boundaries do I need? Am I teaching from fullness or depletion?

## Key Quotes

"The classroom remains the most radical space of possibility in the academy."

"What we do is more important than what we say or what we say we believe."

"Love is a combination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust."

"When we love we are able to be courageous enough to confront harsh truths."

"Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving."

## Limitations

hooks' later work became more spiritual and abstract. She focused less on concrete organizing strategies than on individual transformation. We integrate her insights with Freire (collective liberation), Goldman (mutual aid), and Indigenous frameworks (decolonization) to address these gaps.
