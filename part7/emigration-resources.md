# Emigration Resources: Getting Out

## When It's Time to Leave

If you're LGBTQ+, a targeted minority, or otherwise in danger in the United States, this guide helps you prepare to leave.

**Your safety comes first. Everything else is secondary.**

### International Recognition

**The Dutch government has reclassified the US as not a safe country.** The EU is voting on similar classification.

This means:
- Official international recognition that the US is unsafe
- May make asylum/refugee applications easier for Americans
- Other countries acknowledge the crisis
- Could affect visa acceptance and refugee processing

**The international community sees what's happening. You're not overreacting.**

### Current Situation (Nov 2025)

**International mail to the US is shut down.** Trump tariffs broke international mail agreements. Most suppliers won't ship to the US anymore. This affects:
- DIY HRT shipments (not arriving reliably)
- Medications from international pharmacies
- International packages in general

**Information is heavily manipulated.** You can't find protests or organizing on Google. Feeds are controlled. This means:
- Research visas/emigration using VPN + multiple sources
- Trust peer networks over official channels
- Verify information through international sources
- Use encrypted communication (Signal, not regular text)

**Leave before it gets harder.** Borders could close. Assets could be frozen. Your demographic could be restricted from travel.

## Common Questions

**"When should I leave?"**
Before you have to. If you're asking, start preparing now.

**"What if I can't afford it?"**
Look into:
- Mutual aid funds
- LGBTQ+ refugee assistance organizations
- Work-exchange programs
- Cheaper destination countries (Southeast Asia, Latin America)
- Community fundraising

**"What about my family?"**
Only you can decide. Your safety matters. They can visit. Or they can come too.

**"I don't speak another language."**
Many countries have English-speaking expat communities. You can learn. Survival is good motivation.

**"What if I'm not sure?"**
Prepare anyway. Better to have options you don't use than need options you don't have.
