# Liberatory Practice: Applying the Framework

This document provides practical guidance on applying liberatory pedagogy in The Multiverse School.

## How This Changes Our Language

### OLD LANGUAGE (Hierarchy, Pathology, Control, Judgment)
❌ "Managing difficult students"  
❌ "Intervening in mental illness"  
❌ "Teacher authority"  
❌ "Behavior problems"  
❌ "Compliance with rules"  
❌ "This student is manipulative" (evaluation/diagnosis)  
❌ "You're being disrespectful" (moral judgment)  

### NEW LANGUAGE (Liberation, Healing, Relationality, Observation)
✅ "Navigating community challenges together"  
✅ "Supporting someone's healing journey"  
✅ "Relational accountability"  
✅ "Behavior that disrupts collective learning"  
✅ "Co-created agreements and consensual boundaries"  
✅ "When I notice [behavior], I feel concerned because our community needs [safety/trust/accessibility]" (NVC observation)  
✅ "The impact I'm observing is..." (describing impact, not judging character)

## Core Principles Reframed

### 1. We Are Co-Learners, Not Managers

**Freire:** "Whoever teaches learns in the act of teaching, and whoever learns teaches in the act of learning."

**This means:**
- Facilitators hold some expertise (technical skills, institutional knowledge)
- Learners hold expertise (lived experience, cultural knowledge, self-knowledge)
- Power exists, but we redistribute it through dialogue and transparency
- We name power dynamics instead of pretending they don't exist

---

### 2. Boundaries Are Consensual, Not Authoritarian

**Goldman:** Voluntary cooperation over coercion.

**This means:**
- Code of Conduct is co-created agreement, not imposed rules
- When someone violates agreements, we ask: "Can you participate consensually?"
- Removal isn't punishment—it's recognizing someone can't be in voluntary relationship right now
- Boundaries protect collective wellbeing, not institutional authority

---

### 3. We Honor Different Ways of Being

**Indigenous wisdom:** Not everything needs a diagnosis.

**This means:**
- Neurodivergence is difference, not disorder
- "Madness" can be wisdom, spiritual emergence, or breaking free
- We don't pathologize—we ask: "What do you need to flourish?"
- DSM-5 labels can be useful tools, but they're not the truth
- Someone's healing journey is theirs to define

---

### 4. Love Is Central to Learning

**bell hooks:** "Love as the practice of freedom."

**This means:**
- We create conditions where souls can be nurtured
- Caring about someone includes confronting harm they cause
- Boundaries are acts of love (protecting community)
- Burnout prevention is love for ourselves
- Daring to love deeply means daring to be accountable

---

### 5. Liberation Is Collective

**Freire:** "No one liberates themselves alone."

**This means:**
- Individual healing happens in community context
- One person's crisis affects the collective
- We balance individual needs with collective wellbeing
- Mutual aid, not saviorism
- "How do we all get free?" not "How do I fix this person?"

---

## Applying This Framework

### When Someone Is Struggling

**DON'T:** "This student has BPD and needs to be managed."

**DO:** "This person is in pain and their coping strategies are harming community. What healing and accountability does everyone need?"

---

### When Setting Boundaries

**DON'T:** "You're violating the rules. You'll be punished."

**DO:** "Our co-created agreement says X. You're doing Y, which harms community. Can you participate in this agreement? If not, we need a different path."

---

### When Teaching

**DON'T:** Banking model—deposit knowledge into passive recipients.

**DO:** Problem-posing—"What do you notice? What questions emerge? What shall we investigate together?"

---

### When Responding to Crisis

**DON'T:** "I must intervene and fix this."

**DO:** "I bear witness to your pain. Here are resources. I'm here alongside you, not to rescue you."

---

## Questions for Reflection

When facing a difficult situation, ask:

1. **Observation (NVC):** What am I actually observing, without judgment or evaluation?
2. **Needs (NVC):** What needs are not being met—for this person, for me, for the community?
3. **Power:** Who holds power here? How can we make it more horizontal?
4. **Pathology:** Are we pathologizing what oppression creates?
5. **Relationality:** How does this affect all our relations?
6. **Liberation:** Does this move us toward freedom or control?
7. **Love:** Are we daring to love deeply (which includes boundaries)?
8. **Collective:** How do we balance individual needs with collective wellbeing?

## Honoring the Tensions

We acknowledge real tensions in applying liberatory pedagogy:

### Tension 1: Love AND Boundaries
- We love people AND we can't sacrifice collective safety
- Both are true. Boundaries are acts of love.

### Tension 2: Horizontal Relationships AND Power Differences
- Facilitators do hold power (experience, access to resources, decision-making)
- We make power transparent and accountable, not invisible
- Pretending power doesn't exist is dishonest

### Tension 3: Honoring Different Ways of Being AND Preventing Harm
- Someone's coping strategy might harm others
- We can honor their struggle AND set boundaries about impact
- Healing is not an excuse for harm

### Tension 4: Mutual Aid AND Not Everyone Can Give Equally
- People have different capacities at different times
- Mutual aid isn't equal exchange—it's collective care
- Some people receive more; some give more; the circle flows

## In Practice

This framework means:

### In the handbook, we:
- Name power instead of obscuring it
- Use healing/liberatory language instead of pathology
- Center relationality and collective wellbeing
- Acknowledge tensions instead of offering false certainties
- Ground boundaries in love and consent, not authority

### In our community, we:
- Practice problem-posing, not banking model
- Facilitate healing, not diagnose and manage
- Build mutual aid, not charity
- Center decolonization and neurodivergence-affirmation
- Dare to love deeply while holding fierce boundaries

---

## This Is Living Practice

This framework is not dogma. It's a living practice we refine together through:
- Dialogue and reflection
- Learning from mistakes
- Accountability when we cause harm
- Celebrating when we get it right
- Trusting the collective wisdom

> **Guiding principle:** Education is the practice of freedom. Love is political praxis. We liberate ourselves together, or not at all. Dare to love deeply—which means daring to be accountable, to set boundaries, to honor different ways of being, and to build toward collective liberation.
