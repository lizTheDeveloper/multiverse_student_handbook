# Neurodivergent Resources & Support

## You're Not Broken

Neurodivergence is **difference, not disorder.** You're not broken. You don't need to be fixed.

This guide helps you find support that affirms how your brain works—not tries to make you "normal."

---

## What Is Neurodivergence?

**Neurodivergent** = Brains that work differently from the statistical majority

**Includes:**
- ADHD (attention, executive function, impulse regulation)
- Autism (sensory processing, social communication, pattern recognition)
- Dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia (learning differences)
- Tourette's and tic disorders
- Some mental health conditions (OCD, bipolar, etc.)
- Traumagenic neurodivergence (C-PTSD, dissociative disorders)

**Neurodivergent ≠ one experience.** Every neurodivergent person is different.

## Finding Neurodivergent-Affirming Support

### What "Affirming" Means

**Neurodivergent-affirming support:**
- ✅ Works with how your brain functions
- ✅ Accommodates differences
- ✅ Values neurodivergent perspectives
- ✅ Doesn't try to make you "normal"
- ✅ Addresses barriers (access, sensory needs, communication styles)

**NOT affirming:**
- ❌ Sees you as broken/deficient
- ❌ Focuses on making you mask better
- ❌ Uses punishment/compliance-based approaches (ABA for autistic people)
- ❌ Pathologizes your way of being
- ❌ "You just need to try harder"
