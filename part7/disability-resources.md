## Finding Disability-Affirming Support

### What "Affirming" Means

**Disability-affirming support:**
- ✅ Social model of disability (society disables, not your body)
- ✅ You're the expert on your experience
- ✅ Accommodations are rights, not favors
- ✅ Disability is part of identity, not tragedy
- ✅ Nothing About Us Without Us

**NOT affirming:**
- ❌ Medical model only (you're broken, need fixing)
- ❌ Inspiration porn ("you're so brave!")
- ❌ Infantilization
- ❌ Ableism
- ❌ Pity

### Disability Justice Framework

**Disability justice principles:**
1. **Intersectionality** - Race, class, gender, disability intersect
2. **Leadership of those most impacted**
3. **Anti-capitalist politic** - Worth isn't productivity
4. **Cross-movement solidarity**
5. **Wholeness** - Not broken
6. **Sustainability** - Pace that honors bodies
7. **Commitment to cross-disability solidarity**
