## Medication

### Finding a Psychiatrist

- **Psychiatrist** - Specialized in psych meds
- **Psychiatric nurse practitioner (PMHNP)** - Can prescribe, often more available

**Find:**

**Telehealth psychiatry:**

- Many individual psychiatrists now offer video

### Medication Q&A

**"Will I be on medication forever?"**
Maybe, maybe not. Some people take meds short-term, some long-term. Both are okay.

**"Will it change who I am?"**
Good meds shouldn't change your personality—they should help you be more yourself (less anxiety/depression/etc. in the way).

If meds make you feel not-yourself, tell your doctor. That's not the right med or dose.

**"What about side effects?"**
Every med has potential side effects. Most are mild. If they're not, tell your doctor—there are other options.

**"Can I stop anytime?"**
NEVER stop psych meds abruptly. Taper with your doctor's guidance.

**"What if I don't want medication?"**
That's your choice. You can do therapy without meds (for many things). Your decision.

**"What if my doctor pressures me?"**
You have the right to decline. If they're not listening, find another doctor.

## When Therapy Isn't Working

- You consistently feel worse after sessions
- Therapist violates boundaries
- Therapist doesn't listen or dismisses you
- You've given it 2-3 months and no progress
- Therapist is judgmental or pathologizing
- You don't feel safe

### What to Do:

1. **Talk to your therapist first**
   - "I'm not feeling like this is working for me. Can we talk about it?"
   - Good therapists will be open to this

2. **If that doesn't help, end it**
   - "I've decided to end therapy. Thank you for your time."
   - You don't owe elaborate explanations

3. **Try someone new**
   - Different therapist, different modality, different approach

**Therapy is a relationship. Not every relationship works. That's okay.**

## Insurance vs. Out-of-Pocket

### Using Insurance

**Pros:**
- Much cheaper
- More accessible

**Cons:**
- Limited provider choice
- Insurance knows your diagnosis
- May limit number of sessions

**Check:**

- What's your copay?
- Do you need referrals?
- Is your therapist in-network?

### Out-of-Pocket / Sliding Scale

**Pros:**
- More provider choice
- Privacy (insurance doesn't know)
- No session limits

**Cons:**
- Expensive ($100-250+ per session)

**Options:**
- Sliding scale therapists
- Training clinics
- Open Path Collective ($30-80)

### Superbills

Some out-of-network therapists provide "superbills" you can submit to insurance for partial reimbursement.

Ask: "Do you provide superbills for out-of-network reimbursement?"

## Alternatives to Traditional Therapy

### Coaching

**What it is:** Forward-focused, goal-oriented

**Not therapy, but can help with:**
- ADHD management
- Life transitions
- Goal-setting
- Accountability

**Find:** Life coaches, ADHD coaches, career coaches

**Note:** Coaches are not licensed therapists. Good for skills, not trauma.

### Spiritual Direction

**Good for:** Existential questions, faith transitions, meaning-making

**Find:** Through religious organizations or [spiritual directors international](https://www.sdicompanions.org/)

## Multiverse Resources

### What Multiverse Offers

## Remember

**You deserve support. Getting help isn't weakness.**

**Therapy isn't forever** (though it can be if you want). It's a tool. Use it when you need it.

**It's okay to try multiple therapists.** Fit matters.

**Medication can help. It doesn't make you weak.**

**You're allowed to heal at your own pace.**
