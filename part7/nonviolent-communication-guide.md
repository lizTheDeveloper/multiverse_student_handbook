# Nonviolent Communication (NVC) for Facilitators

## What Is Nonviolent Communication?

Nonviolent Communication (NVC), developed by Marshall Rosenberg, is a framework for communicating with compassion and clarity. It helps us connect with ourselves and others by focusing on observations, feelings, needs, and requests—rather than judgments, diagnoses, or demands.

**Why it matters for The Multiverse:** NVC helps us avoid pathologizing people while still addressing behaviors that affect collective wellbeing. It shifts us from "what's wrong with this person?" to "what needs are not being met?"

## The Four Components of NVC

### 1. **Observations** (Not Evaluations)

**Observations:** Describe what you see or hear without adding judgment, interpretation, or diagnosis.

**Evaluations:** Mix observation with judgment, morality, or pathology.

| ❌ Evaluation (Judgment) | ✅ Observation (Facts) |
|---|---|
| "You're being manipulative" | "When I notice that you ask for support and then refuse the resources offered..." |
| "This student is unstable" | "I've observed three emotional crises in the past two weeks" |
| "You're disrespectful" | "When you interrupt others during class..." |
| "They're attention-seeking" | "I notice frequent posts in the channel requesting immediate responses" |

**Why this matters:** Evaluations trigger defensiveness. Observations open dialogue.

---

### 2. **Feelings** (Not Thoughts Disguised as Feelings)

**Feelings:** Emotions arising in your body (scared, frustrated, joyful, sad, confused).

**Thoughts disguised as feelings:** Often start with "I feel like/that..." and express interpretations, not emotions.

| ❌ Thought | ✅ Feeling |
|---|---|
| "I feel like you don't care" | "I feel hurt" or "I feel disconnected" |
| "I feel manipulated" | "I feel uneasy" or "I feel confused" |
| "I feel attacked" | "I feel scared" or "I feel defensive" |

**Common feelings vocabulary:**
- **When needs are met:** Grateful, hopeful, energized, peaceful, inspired, relieved
- **When needs are not met:** Frustrated, anxious, overwhelmed, sad, confused, discouraged

**Why this matters:** Naming real feelings creates connection and vulnerability. Thoughts disguised as feelings blame others.

### 3. **Needs** (Universal Human Needs, Not Strategies)

**Needs:** Universal human values like safety, understanding, autonomy, community, respect, rest.

**Strategies:** Specific ways we try to meet needs (not universal).

| ❌ Strategy | ✅ Need |
|---|---|
| "I need you to stop talking" | "I need respect" or "I need space to think" |
| "I need you to be on time" | "I need reliability" or "I need predictability" |
| "I need you to get therapy" | "I need safety in our learning space" |

**Universal human needs:**
- **Physical wellbeing:** Safety, rest, food, shelter, health
- **Connection:** Love, community, belonging, understanding, empathy
- **Autonomy:** Choice, freedom, independence, agency
- **Meaning:** Purpose, contribution, growth, creativity, learning
- **Play:** Joy, humor, fun, spontaneity

**Why this matters:** When we connect to needs, we find compassion. When we focus only on strategies, we create conflict.

---

### 4. **Requests** (Not Demands)

**Requests:** Clear, specific, actionable asks that the other person can say "no" to without negative consequences.

**Demands:** Threats, ultimatums, or requests that carry punishment for refusal.

| ❌ Demand | ✅ Request |
|---|---|
| "Stop interrupting or you'll be removed" | "Would you be willing to wait until others finish speaking before adding your thoughts?" |
| "You need to get help" | "Would you be open to connecting with a therapist? I can share resources if that would help." |
| "Don't contact me outside of class" | "Would you be willing to keep our communication to class time and asynchronous channels?" |

**Requests should be:**
- **Specific:** Not vague ("be better") but concrete ("send messages during waking hours")
- **Actionable:** The person can do it right now or in near future
- **Positive:** Ask for what you want, not what you don't want
- **Truly optional:** They can say no without consequences

**Why this matters:** Requests invite cooperation. Demands create compliance or rebellion.

## The NVC Formula

**"When I see/hear [observation], I feel [feeling] because I need [need]. Would you be willing to [request]?"**

### Example 1: Addressing Frequent Interruptions

❌ **Judgmental:** "You're rude and you never let anyone else talk."

✅ **NVC:** "When I notice that you've spoken without pausing for others to respond several times in today's session, I feel concerned because I value everyone having space to contribute. Would you be willing to pause after sharing an idea to see if others want to add thoughts?"

### Example 2: Addressing Late-Night Messages

❌ **Judgmental:** "You're being inappropriate and crossing boundaries."

✅ **NVC:** "When I receive messages after 11pm, I feel stressed because I need rest and separation between work and personal time. Would you be willing to send non-urgent messages during business hours (9am-6pm)?"

### Example 3: Addressing Crisis Sharing

❌ **Judgmental:** "You're being dramatic and seeking attention."

✅ **NVC:** "When I see crisis disclosures in the learning channel multiple times per week, I feel overwhelmed because I need the learning space to feel safe and focused for everyone. Would you be willing to share personal crises in designated support channels or with a therapist, and keep the learning channel focused on coursework?"

## NVC in Practice at Multiverse

### Recognizing Patterns Without Pathologizing

Instead of:
> "This student has borderline personality disorder and is manipulating us."

Try:
> "I'm observing a pattern: requests for support followed by rejection of resources, intense emotional reactions to boundaries, and frequent crises. I feel concerned because I need to protect my own capacity and the collective learning space. What support might help this person while maintaining community safety?"

### Setting Boundaries with Compassion

Instead of:
> "You're being disruptive. One more incident and you're out."

Try:
> "When interruptions happen frequently during class, I feel frustrated because I value everyone's ability to learn and contribute. I also feel concerned for your wellbeing because this pattern might signal you need different support. Would you be willing to talk with me about what's happening and what would help?"

### Escalating with Clarity

Instead of:
> "You're in violation of our code of conduct."

Try:
> "When I see [specific behavior], I notice it's affecting [specific impact on community]. Our co-created agreement says [specific rule]. I need to know: can you participate in this agreement? If not, we may need to explore whether this learning space is the right fit for you right now."

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. **Using NVC Language to Manipulate**

NVC is not a script to get what you want. It's a practice of genuine connection.

❌ **Fake NVC:** "When you don't do what I ask, I feel sad because I need respect, so you should do what I say."

✅ **Real NVC:** "When my requests aren't responded to, I feel confused because I need clarity about our working relationship. Can we talk about what's happening?"

### 2. **Over-Explaining or Being Indirect**

NVC doesn't mean being wishy-washy. You can be direct and clear while still being compassionate.

❌ **Too indirect:** "I'm wondering if maybe, possibly, if it's okay with you, you might consider perhaps thinking about..."

✅ **Direct + compassionate:** "I need to set a clear boundary. Would you be willing to keep our contact to class time only?"

### 3. **Expecting NVC to "Fix" the Other Person**

NVC is about connection, not control. The other person may hear you and still say no.

**Remember:** You can use NVC perfectly and still need to set consequences or remove someone from community.

## NVC + Relational Accountability

NVC helps us communicate with compassion. Relational accountability helps us maintain boundaries.

**Both are necessary:**

1. **NVC:** "When I see [behavior], I feel [feeling] because I need [need]. Would you be willing to [request]?"

2. **Relational Accountability:** "If you're not able to participate in this agreement, we'll need to pause your community participation while you access the support you need."

**You can hold deep compassion AND fierce boundaries.**

## Quick Reference Card

### NVC Formula
1. **Observation:** What I see/hear (no judgment)
2. **Feeling:** Emotion in my body (not thought)
3. **Need:** Universal human value (not strategy)
4. **Request:** Specific, actionable, truly optional

### Example
"When I see [observation], I feel [feeling] because I need [need]. Would you be willing to [request]?"

### Distinguishing Observation from Evaluation
- ❌ Evaluation: "You're being difficult"
- ✅ Observation: "When you respond 'no' to the past three suggestions I've made..."

### Distinguishing Feelings from Thoughts
- ❌ Thought: "I feel like you don't care"
- ✅ Feeling: "I feel hurt" or "I feel lonely"

### Distinguishing Needs from Strategies
- ❌ Strategy: "I need you to apologize"
- ✅ Need: "I need acknowledgment" or "I need repair"

### Distinguishing Requests from Demands
- ❌ Demand: "Stop or you're out"
- ✅ Request: "Would you be willing to try a different approach?"

## Remember

**NVC is a practice, not perfection.** You won't always get it right. The goal is to:
- Observe without judging
- Feel without blaming
- Connect to needs (yours and theirs)
- Make requests, not demands

**NVC + boundaries = liberatory care.**

You can honor someone's humanity while still saying "this behavior doesn't work for our community."

> **Guiding principle:** "NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish." — Marshall Rosenberg
