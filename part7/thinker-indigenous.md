# Indigenous Perspectives: Relational Accountability & Healing-Centered Practice

Indigenous pedagogies represent thousands of years of wisdom about learning, relationship, and knowledge transmission. These traditions offer frameworks for education rooted in interconnection, healing, and collective wellbeing rather than individualism, pathology, and competition.

**Important:** This document draws on scholarship by Indigenous educators and researchers. We (The Multiverse School) are learning from these traditions with respect and humility, not claiming to represent them.

## The Core Framework: Relational Accountability ("All My Relations")

Central to many Indigenous worldviews is the concept often expressed as "All my relations" (*Mitakuye Oyasin* in Lakota, variations in many languages).

### What Relational Accountability Means

We are not separate individuals. We exist in a web of relationships—with human community, ancestors and future generations, land and water, animals and plants, spirit. Our actions ripple through this web. When one suffers, all suffer. When one heals, conditions for collective healing emerge.

This isn't metaphor or poetry. It's a fundamental understanding of reality: individual wellbeing is inseparable from collective wellbeing. You don't heal in isolation—you heal in connection. You're not accountable just to yourself—you're accountable to all your relations (past, present, future).

### Applied to Education

In relational accountability framework:
- Learning is relational (we learn with and from each other, not alone)
- Knowledge carries responsibility (what you learn, you're responsible to use well)
- Your growth affects others' growth (individual transformation creates conditions for collective transformation)
- We ask "How does this affect all our relations?" not just "How does this affect me?"

**In practice:** When making a decision—about curriculum, about how to respond to someone struggling, about community agreements—you consider not just individual impact but relational impact. How does this affect the web of relationships? What are we accountable to beyond immediate outcomes?

## Traditional Indigenous Learning: Observation, Practice, Reflection

Traditional Indigenous learning commonly involves observation, supervised participation, and private self-testing rather than direct instruction.

### The Learning Cycle

**Observe** skilled practitioners doing the work. You watch, you pay attention, you notice.

**Practice with supervision** nearby but not hovering. Someone is available if needed, but you're doing the work.

**Self-test privately** where failure doesn't carry shame. You try on your own, make mistakes, figure it out.

**Reflect** on what worked, what didn't, what you're learning.

**Act again** with new understanding.

This cycle develops embodied knowledge, not abstract concepts. You learn by doing real work, not by receiving information disconnected from practice. Failure is expected and private—you're not humiliated for not knowing yet.

**In The Multiverse:** Project-based learning, apprenticeship models, real work (not simulations), space for experimentation and failure, learning integrated with doing.

## Elders: Wisdom, Not Command

In Indigenous communities, Elders are the most respected educators—but this isn't hierarchical authority in the Western sense.

### The Elder Framework

Elders don't command obedience. They model values, offer guidance when sought, share stories that contain teachings, create conditions for learning. Respect is earned through wisdom, character, and service—not demanded through position.

Learners choose when to seek guidance. Teaching happens through example and story, not through lectures or requirements. The Elder's role is to facilitate learning, not to manage or control learners.

**The distinction:** Authority from wisdom (people seek you out because you know things worth knowing) vs. authority from position (people must obey because you have institutional power).

**In The Multiverse:** We honor lived experience. We learn from those who've walked the path. Authority comes from what you know and how you've lived, not from your title. Facilitators as guides, not commanders.

## Healing-Centered vs. Trauma-Informed

Indigenous frameworks challenge the medical model's focus on pathology and individual diagnosis.

### The Shift in Questions

**Trauma-informed asks:** "What's wrong with you?" "What trauma did you experience?" The focus is on pathology, symptoms, diagnosis.

**Healing-centered asks:** "What happened to you?" (context and systemic causes), "What is right with you?" (strengths and resilience), "What healing do you need?" (support and growth, not symptoms and treatment).

### Why This Matters

Trauma-informed approaches, while better than ignoring trauma, can still pathologize. They locate the problem in the individual ("you have PTSD") rather than in the systems that created the trauma ("you survived white supremacist violence"). They risk extracting trauma narratives without offering healing. They focus on symptoms rather than wholeness.

Healing-centered approaches recognize that what looks like "mental illness" is often rational response to oppressive conditions. They honor survival strategies—you developed these adaptations because they kept you alive. Now you may need different strategies, but the old ones weren't irrational.

**The framework shift:** From "fixing broken individuals" to "creating conditions where people can heal in community."

## Decolonizing Mental Health: Not Everything Needs a Diagnosis

The DSM-5 was created in a colonial, white supremacist context. It pathologizes what oppression creates and what resistance looks like.

### Historical Context

The psychiatric establishment has diagnosed resistance as illness:
- Enslaved people who fled were diagnosed with "drapetomania" (disease causing slaves to run away)
- Women's anger was "hysteria"
- Homosexuality was in the DSM until 1973
- Indigenous spiritual practices were labeled "psychotic"

Today, poverty, racism, and violence create "symptoms" that get diagnosed as individual "disorders." We medicalize what we should politicize.

### The Framework: Diagnosis as Tool, Not Truth

Diagnosis can be useful—it can connect someone to resources, help them understand their experience, provide language for support needs. But it's not the truth. It's one framework among many.

**Alternative frameworks that may coexist:**
- Spiritual emergence (what psychiatry calls "psychosis" may be spiritual awakening)
- Ancestral calling (visions, voices may be connection to ancestors)
- Breaking free from oppression (what looks like "instability" may be liberation)
- Neurodivergence as difference, not disorder
- "Madness" as wisdom, rebellion, or survival

**In practice:** Let the person name their own experience. Offer frameworks (including diagnosis if relevant), but don't impose interpretation. Ask "What do you need to flourish?" not "What's your diagnosis?"

## The Four Rs: Indigenous Education Framework

From Blackfoot educator Leroy Little Bear and others: Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, Responsibility.

### Respect

For Elders, knowledge keepers, community. For different ways of knowing. For land, water, all living beings. For each person's journey and timing.

Respect means you don't impose one right way. You honor that people come to understanding through different paths. You don't rush or force. You create conditions and trust the process.

### Relevance

Learning connected to students' lives and communities. Knowledge serves the community, not just individual advancement. Practical, applicable learning that matters.

If students don't see how learning connects to their actual lives, they're right to question its relevance. Education that serves credentials but not life is extractive.

### Reciprocity

Learning is mutual exchange. Teachers learn from students. Knowledge shared comes with responsibility to give back. What you receive, you're accountable to use in service of community.

Not transactional (I give X, you give X back) but relational (we're in ongoing exchange, help flows in multiple directions).

### Responsibility

To ancestors, community, future generations. To use knowledge well. To contribute to collective wellbeing. Relational accountability in action.

You're not just learning for yourself. You're learning for all your relations. What you know, you're responsible to share and use wisely.

## Storytelling as Pedagogy

Indigenous education often uses storytelling as primary teaching method—not as supplement to "real teaching" but as the teaching itself.

### Why Stories Teach

Stories contain layered teachings. You learn what you're ready to learn. A child hears one teaching; an adult hears another; an Elder hears yet another—same story, different layers.

Stories are relational, told in community. They engage imagination and emotion, not just intellect. They can be revisited at different life stages, offering new wisdom each time.

Stories pass down cultural knowledge, explain relationships between beings, teach consequences without lecturing. They're not just information—they're transmission of wisdom.

**In practice:** Case studies, scenarios, sharing stories of what worked and what didn't. Not "here's the rule" but "here's what happened when..." (See [Part VI: Case Studies](../part6/case-aspiring-guru.md))

## Montessori and Indigenous Pedagogy: Convergent Wisdom

You asked about Montessori connections to Indigenous practices. The research shows remarkable overlap, though not direct historical lineage.

### Not Derived, But Aligned

Maria Montessori (1870-1952) developed her methods in Italy through European scientific observation. She didn't derive them from Indigenous practices. However, both traditions arrived at similar principles—suggesting possible universal wisdom about how humans learn.

### Shared Principles

**Observation and self-directed learning:** Indigenous children learn through watching and private self-testing. Montessori children choose activities and learn through doing.

**Mixed-age communities:** Indigenous extended family learning (all ages together). Montessori multi-age classrooms.

**Hands-on experiential learning:** Both center learning by doing real work, not abstract exercises.

**Respect for autonomy:** Indigenous view of children as capable agents. Montessori's "help me do it myself."

**Connection to environment:** Indigenous place-based learning. Montessori prepared environment and nature connection.

**Intrinsic motivation:** Both reject rewards/punishments. Learning emerges from natural curiosity.

### Indigenous Montessori Movement Today

Contemporary Indigenous educators are reclaiming and combining both traditions:

**Indigenous Montessori Institute (IMI)** founded by Trisha Moquino (Keres/Laguna Pueblo) combines Indigenous knowledge systems with Montessori philosophy. The Keres Children's Learning Center offers Keres language immersion using Montessori pedagogy.

This isn't appropriation—it's Indigenous educators recognizing overlap and integrating both wisdom traditions in service of Indigenous children's education and language revitalization.

**What this suggests:** Possible convergent evolution toward similar truths about learning. Not one tradition borrowing from another, but different cultures arriving at similar insights.

## Applying Indigenous Frameworks in The Multiverse

### Shift 1: From Pathology to Healing

Old model: "This student has a disorder. Let's manage symptoms."

Indigenous framework: "This person is in pain. What happened to them? What healing do they need? How do we support their wholeness?"

See all mental health sections—they apply healing-centered framing.

### Shift 2: From Individual to Relational

Old model: "This is an individual problem to fix."

Indigenous framework: "How does this affect all our relations? What's happening in the community that this pattern emerges?"

### Shift 3: From Diagnosis to Observation

Old model: "They have BPD/ADHD/depression."

Indigenous framework: "I observe these patterns. The person may find diagnosis useful or not. My role is to support their flourishing, however they understand their experience."

### Shift 4: From Isolation to Connection

Old model: "When in crisis, isolate and treat individually."

Indigenous framework: "Healing happens in community. How do we stay in relationship while maintaining appropriate boundaries?"

## Practical Tools

**The "All My Relations" Check:**
Before decisions, ask: How does this affect the web of relationships? Am I considering only immediate individual impact, or relational/collective impact?

**The Healing-Centered Question:**
Instead of "What's wrong with them?" ask "What happened? What is right with them? What healing do they need?"

**The Four Rs Audit:**
Check your practice: Am I showing respect? Is this relevant to students' lives? Am I practicing reciprocity? Am I being responsible to community and future?

**The Observation-Practice-Reflection Cycle:**
Structure learning: Observe practitioners → Practice with light supervision → Self-test privately → Reflect → Act again

## Key Quotes

"We are responsible to all our relations—past, present, and future."

"Healing incorporates physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions through relationships which occur alongside the healing journey."

"Not everything needs a diagnosis."
