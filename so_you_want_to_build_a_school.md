**So You Want to Build a School**

_90-Day Visionary Incubation Track_

This is a 12-week grounding sequence for people who feel called to start their own school, omniversity, learning temple, or community academy. The goal is not to crush your vision—it’s to make sure you’re ready to steward something that affects real lives.

> If you complete all 12 weeks, you're welcome to book a meeting with us to discuss your idea.
