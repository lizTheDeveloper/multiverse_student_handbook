# Understanding the Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This guide helps you understand how the Code of Conduct works at Multiverse:
- How it maintains community safety
- How it accommodates neurodivergent communication styles
- How transformative justice principles are applied
- How consequences work
- Why transparency and privacy are balanced

**From disability justice:** A good Code of Conduct protects people, not just rules. It's a living document, not a weapon.

---

## What Belongs in a Code of Conduct

### Core Principles

**From transformative justice research (AWN):** A neurodivergent-affirming Code of Conduct should:

1. **Focus on impact, not intent**
   - What matters is whether harm occurred, not whether harm was intended
   - Neurodivergent people often have mismatched intent and impact

2. **Distinguish style from safety**
   - Direct communication isn't rude
   - Missing social cues isn't disrespect
   - Disability accommodations aren't special treatment

3. **Prioritize repair over punishment**
   - Can the person take accountability?
   - What would help the harmed person?
   - How do we prevent recurrence?

4. **Be explicit, not implied**
   - Autistic people need concrete examples, not vague expectations
   - "Be respectful" is too vague
   - "Don't insult people's appearance, intelligence, or identity" is clear

5. **Allow for learning**
   - First violations (if not severe) are teaching moments
   - Progressive consequences for repeated violations
   - Immediate removal only for serious harm

---

### What to Include

**Essential sections:**

#### 1. Acceptable Behavior (Not Just Prohibited)

**Why this matters:** Neurodivergent people benefit from knowing what TO do, not just what NOT to do.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Ask before sharing others' personal information"
- ✅ "If someone says you've hurt them, listen and try to understand"
- ✅ "Use content warnings for potentially triggering topics"
- ✅ "Respect people's communication preferences (DMs, public, none)"

---

#### 2. Prohibited Behavior (With Clear Definitions)

**Don't just list banned things—define them.**

**Example of vague (bad):**
- ❌ "No harassment"

**Example of clear (good):**
- ✅ "Harassment includes: repeated unwanted contact after someone asks you to stop, sexual comments, mocking someone's disability, doxxing, deliberate misgendering"

**Categories to address:**

**Immediate removal offenses:**
- Violence or credible threats of violence
- Sexual harassment or predatory behavior
- Doxxing (sharing private information to harm)
- Recruiting for dangerous/exploitative projects
- Stalking across platforms
- Deliberate sabotage of community infrastructure

**Progressive discipline offenses:**
- Boundary violations (repeated after warnings)
- Disrespecting communication boundaries
- Crisis dependency without using appropriate resources
- Manipulation or coercion
- Consistent disruption despite feedback

**Not violations:**
- Direct/blunt communication style
- Disagreeing with staff
- Missing social cues
- Asking for accommodations
- Having mental health crises (if using appropriate support)
- Being "weird" or different

---

#### 3. Accommodations & Flexibility

**Critical for neurodivergent-affirming spaces:**

**Include language like:**
> "We recognize that neurodivergent people communicate differently. Direct communication, missing social cues, and needing explicit instructions are not Code of Conduct violations. What matters is whether you're willing to repair harm when it occurs."

> "If you make a mistake, we'll tell you directly and specifically. You'll have a chance to correct the behavior. Enforcement is progressive except for serious safety violations."

> "We accommodate disability, including mental health conditions. Accommodation doesn't mean consequence-free harmful behavior—it means flexibility in how we address it."

---

#### 4. Enforcement Process

**Be explicit about:**
- Who enforces (admins, teachers, moderators?)
- How decisions are made
- What progressive discipline looks like
- When removal happens
- Whether appeals are possible
- How privacy is handled

**Example:**
> "Code of Conduct violations are addressed progressively:
> 1. First violation (non-serious): Direct communication about what happened and why it's a concern
> 2. Second violation: Warning with documentation
> 3. Third violation: Temporary or permanent removal, depending on severity
>
> Serious violations (threats, harassment, predatory behavior) result in immediate removal without warnings."

---

#### 5. Reporting & Response

**Make it clear HOW to report violations:**

> "If someone violates the Code of Conduct, you can:
> - Message [admin name/email] directly
> - Use the anonymous reporting form [link]
> - Ask a teacher to escalate to admin
>
> Reports will be reviewed within [timeframe]. You'll receive confirmation that we received your report. We'll let you know the outcome to the extent we can while respecting privacy."

**What happens after a report:**
1. Admin receives and confirms receipt
2. Investigation (gather facts from involved parties)
3. Decision based on evidence and past patterns
4. Consequences applied
5. Reporter notified of outcome (general, not all details)
6. Documentation in private admin records

---

#### 6. Privacy & Transparency

**Clarify what information is shared:**

**Private (never shared publicly):**
- Reporter's identity (unless they choose to disclose)
- Mental health disclosures
- Specific details of investigations
- Why someone was removed (if personal/medical)

**Shared with affected parties:**
- That a report was made
- General nature of the concern
- Decision and consequences

**Shared publicly:**
- Disaffiliation if someone is claiming association after removal
- Safety warnings if ongoing risk
- General patterns ("We've noticed X behavior; here's a reminder about Y")

---

### Sample Code of Conduct Structure

```markdown
# The Multiverse School Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Multiverse School is a neurodivergent-led learning community. We center the needs and communication styles of neurodivergent people while maintaining safety for all participants.

## Expected Behavior

We ask all community members to:
- Communicate directly and specifically when someone's behavior affects you
- Accept feedback when your actions have harmed someone, even if harm wasn't intended
- Use content warnings for potentially triggering topics (violence, sexual content, detailed trauma)
- Respect people's stated boundaries (communication preferences, topics to avoid, etc.)
- Ask before sharing others' personal information
- Use people's correct names and pronouns
- Assume good intent while addressing impact

## What's NOT a Violation

We recognize neurodivergent communication styles and won't penalize:
- Direct or blunt communication
- Missing unstated social expectations
- Asking clarifying questions
- Requesting accommodations
- Stimming, echolalia, or other neurodivergent traits
- Having mental health struggles (when using appropriate support)
- Being visibly disabled or "different"

## Prohibited Behavior

### Immediate Removal (No Warnings)

- Physical violence or credible threats of violence
- Sexual harassment or predatory behavior
- Doxxing (sharing private information to harm someone)
- Recruiting members for cults, pyramid schemes, or unsafe living situations
- Sustained stalking or harassment across platforms
- Intentional sabotage of community resources

### Progressive Discipline (Warnings → Removal)

- Repeated boundary violations after being asked to stop
- Crisis dependency (using community as substitute for crisis resources despite redirection)
- Manipulation, coercion, or intentional harm
- Consistent disruption of learning environment
- Refusal to respect stated boundaries after multiple conversations

## Enforcement Process

**Step 1: Direct Communication**
For most first-time violations, we'll contact you directly to explain what happened and why it's a concern. You'll have a chance to respond and correct the behavior.

**Step 2: Warning**
If the behavior continues, you'll receive a formal warning with documentation. We'll be specific about what needs to change.

**Step 3: Removal**
After multiple warnings (or immediately for serious violations), you may be temporarily or permanently removed from the community.

**Appeals:**
You may appeal a removal decision if you have new information or believe the process wasn't followed. Email [contact] within 7 days.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a Code of Conduct violation:
- Email [admin contact]
- Use the anonymous form [link]
- Ask a teacher to escalate

You'll receive confirmation within 24 hours. We'll investigate and respond within [timeframe].

## Privacy

- Reporter identities are kept confidential unless you choose to disclose
- We share general outcomes, not detailed explanations
- Public disaffiliation only when necessary for safety

## Changes to This Code

This Code of Conduct will be updated as we learn. Major changes will be announced. Last updated: [date]
```

---

## How to Enforce Consistently

### The Challenge

**Consistent enforcement is hard because:**
- You like some students more than others (human nature)
- Some violations feel more serious emotionally (even if they're not)
- Pressure from community ("Everyone loves them, don't remove them!")
- Your own capacity varies (easier to enforce when not burned out)

**Why it matters:**
- Inconsistency breeds resentment ("Why did X get away with it?")
- Students learn they can manipulate outcomes
- Community loses trust in leadership
- You make decisions based on feelings, not facts

---

### Framework for Consistency

**From transformative justice:** Enforce based on behavior and pattern, not based on who you like.

#### Rule 1: Document Everything

**Every Code of Conduct concern should be documented:**
- Date and time
- What happened (specific, factual)
- Who was involved
- What was said/done in response
- Past pattern (is this first time or repeat?)

**This protects you from:**
- Faulty memory
- Bias (harder to play favorites when facts are clear)
- Accusations of unfairness
- Second-guessing yourself

---

#### Rule 2: Same Violation = Same Consequences

**Create a rubric:**

| Violation Type | First Instance | Second Instance | Third Instance |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Missed communication boundary | Direct conversation | Written warning | 1-week pause |
| Crisis messaging outside hours | Resource referral | Warning + documentation | Temporary removal |
| Disrespectful language | Direct feedback | Warning | 2-week pause |
| Boundary violation with another student | Warning + mediation if appropriate | Temporary removal | Permanent removal |
| Harassment | Immediate temporary removal | Permanent removal | N/A |
| Violence/threats | Immediate permanent removal | N/A | N/A |

**Apply this regardless of:**
- How much you like the student
- Their circumstances (trauma, housing, etc.)
- How talented/valuable they are
- How long they've been in community

**Circumstances can affect how you communicate consequences, but not what the consequences are.**

---

#### Rule 3: Multiple Enforcers Review Serious Decisions

**For temporary or permanent removal:**
- At least 2 people review the decision
- Review documentation together
- Check: "Would we make this decision for any student?"
- Document reasoning

**This protects against:**
- Individual bias
- Emotional decisions
- Overlooking context
- Unfair targeting

---

### Neurodivergent-Affirming Enforcement

**Key principle:** Distinguish the WHAT from the WHY.

**The WHAT:** What behavior occurred? (This is what you enforce)

**The WHY:** Why did it happen? (This affects HOW you enforce, not WHETHER)

**Example:**

**Student A:** Sends late-night crisis messages because they're in active mental health crisis and don't know about 988
**Student B:** Sends late-night crisis messages as a pattern to get attention/connection with specific teacher

**The WHAT is the same:** Repeated late-night messages outside boundaries

**The WHY is different:**
- Student A needs education about resources
- Student B needs firmer boundaries about crisis dependency

**The consequence might be the same** (must use 988, can't message teacher at night), **but the approach differs:**
- Student A: "I understand this is hard. Here's 988. This is the resource that can help you nights/weekends."
- Student B: "You've been given crisis resources multiple times. Continuing to message me instead of using them is a boundary violation. If it happens again, we'll need to pause your participation."

---

## Progressive Discipline in Practice

### The Model

**From restorative justice research:**

**Level 1: Education & Redirection** (First-time, non-serious violations)
- Assume ignorance, not malice
- Explain what happened and why it's a problem
- Provide concrete alternative behavior
- Document, but no formal consequences yet

**Level 2: Warning & Boundary-Setting** (Repeated or moderate violations)
- Acknowledge pattern
- Clear warning about consequences if it continues
- Written documentation
- May include temporary restrictions

**Level 3: Temporary Removal** (Continued pattern or serious one-time violations)
- Pause participation for set period (days to months)
- Clear conditions for return
- Focus on safety, not punishment

**Level 4: Permanent Removal** (Sustained pattern or severe violations)
- No return
- Public disaffiliation if necessary for safety

---

### Scripts for Each Level

#### Level 1: Education & Redirection

**Template:**
> "[Student], I want to talk with you about [specific behavior] that happened [when/where].
>
> Here's what I observed: [factual, specific description]
>
> Here's why this is a concern: [impact on others, community safety, etc.]
>
> Going forward, here's what I need from you: [concrete, specific alternative behavior]
>
> Do you understand? Do you have questions?"

**Example:**
> "Morgan, I want to talk with you about messaging Jamie at 2am last night.
>
> Here's what happened: You sent Jamie three messages between 2-3am about feeling suicidal.
>
> Here's why this is a concern: Jamie isn't available for crisis support outside of office hours (9am-6pm weekdays). When you're in crisis nights or weekends, the right resource is 988 Lifeline, not your teacher.
>
> Going forward, here's what I need: If you're in crisis outside Jamie's hours, call 988 (voice or text). You can let Jamie know the next day that you were struggling, but the crisis support needs to come from 988.
>
> Do you understand?"

---

#### Level 2: Warning & Boundary-Setting

**Template:**
> "[Student], we need to talk about [behavior] again. This is now the [second/third] time this has happened:
> - [Date]: [What happened]
> - [Date]: [What happened]
> - [Today's date]: [What happened]
>
> We've talked about [alternative behavior] before. This pattern is continuing.
>
> This is a formal warning. If [behavior] happens again, the consequence will be [specific consequence: temporary pause, removal from certain channels, etc.].
>
> I need a clear commitment from you that you'll [alternative behavior]. Can you make that commitment?"

**Example:**
> "Morgan, we need to talk about late-night crisis messages again. This is now the third time:
> - March 3: Messaged Jamie at 2am about housing crisis
> - March 15: Messaged Jamie at 11pm about relationship problems
> - Today (March 28): Messaged Jamie at 1am about suicidal thoughts
>
> We've talked about using 988 for night/weekend crises. You've been given the number multiple times. This pattern is continuing.
>
> This is a formal warning. If you message Jamie (or any teacher) about a crisis outside of office hours again instead of calling 988, you'll be paused from the program for 2 weeks.
>
> I need a clear commitment from you that you'll call 988 when you're in crisis outside business hours. Can you make that commitment?"

---

#### Level 3: Temporary Removal

**Template:**
> "[Student], I'm writing to let you know that we're pausing your participation in The Multiverse School for [duration].
>
> Here's why:
> [List specific incidents with dates]
>
> Despite [warnings/conversations], this pattern has continued. We need to create space for you to [get additional support/address this pattern/stabilize].
>
> During this pause:
> - You won't have access to [classes, Discord, office hours, etc.]
> - The pause will last [duration or "until X conditions are met"]
> - Here are resources for support: [988, therapy referrals, etc.]
>
> To return, you'll need to:
> [Specific, measurable conditions]
>
> You can contact me at [email] if you have questions. This decision is final for the duration stated, but we're open to discussing return once conditions are met."

*(See removal-reentry.md for detailed templates)*

---

#### Level 4: Permanent Removal

**Template:**
> "[Student], I'm writing to inform you that you're permanently removed from The Multiverse School, effective immediately.
>
> Here's why:
> [Specific serious violations OR sustained pattern despite multiple interventions]
>
> This decision is final. You will not be able to return.
>
> [If applicable: We are also publicly disaffiliating, meaning we'll clarify to our community that you are not affiliated with us.]"

*(See removal-reentry.md for detailed templates)*

## When to Skip Progressive Discipline

### Immediate Removal Situations

**Some violations are severe enough to skip warnings:**

1. **Violence or credible threats**
   - Physical violence against community members
   - "I'm going to hurt/kill [person]" (credible)
   - Stalking behavior

2. **Sexual harassment or predatory behavior**
   - Unwanted sexual advances after being told to stop
   - Sexual comments about people without consent
   - Grooming behavior
   - Sharing sexual content without consent

3. **Doxxing**
   - Sharing someone's private information (address, phone, deadname, etc.) with intent to harm
   - "Exposing" someone across platforms

4. **Recruitment for harmful projects**
   - Trying to recruit community members into cults
   - Pyramid schemes/MLMs targeting vulnerable students
   - Unsafe "intentional communities" or housing

5. **Sustained pattern after multiple chances**
   - You've done progressive discipline, it hasn't worked
   - Behavior is escalating, not improving

---

### How to Decide: Immediate vs. Progressive

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Is there imminent danger?**
   - YES → Immediate removal
   - NO → Move to #2

2. **Is this a first-time offense?**
   - YES + not severe → Progressive discipline
   - NO (repeated pattern) → Move to #3

3. **Have warnings been given?**
   - NO → Start with education/warning
   - YES, multiple times → Removal appropriate

4. **Is the behavior likely to stop with feedback?**
   - YES → Progressive approach
   - NO (entrenched pattern) → Removal

5. **Does keeping them present risk others' safety?**
   - YES → Remove
   - NO → Progressive approach

---

## Appeals Process

### When Appeals Are Appropriate

**Students can appeal a removal if:**
- They have new information not previously considered
- They believe the process wasn't followed correctly
- They believe the decision was based on false information

**Not grounds for appeal:**
- "I disagree with your interpretation"
- "That's not fair"
- "Other people did worse and didn't get removed"
- "I have trauma/disability" (already considered in decision-making)

---

### Appeals Process

**Step 1: Student submits written appeal**
- Within 7 days of removal decision
- To designated admin (ideally not the person who made initial decision)
- Must include: specific grounds for appeal, new information/evidence

**Step 2: Review**
- Admin reviews original documentation
- Consults with original decision-maker
- May speak to student if needed
- May consult external advisor

**Step 3: Decision**
- Made within 7-14 days
- Options: uphold removal, modify (permanent → temporary, for example), overturn
- Decision is final (no second appeal)

**Step 4: Communication**
- Student notified in writing
- Brief explanation of reasoning
- Next steps if applicable

---

### Template: Appeal Response (Denied)

> "[Student],
>
> Thank you for your appeal regarding your removal from The Multiverse School.
>
> I've reviewed:
> - Your appeal letter
> - Original documentation of incidents
> - Consultation with [admin who made decision]
>
> After careful review, I'm upholding the removal decision. Here's why:
> [Brief, factual explanation]
>
> The information you provided in your appeal [doesn't change the facts of what occurred / was already considered in the original decision / etc.].
>
> This decision is final. Per our policies, there is no further appeal process.
>
> [If temporary: You may request re-entry after [date] by contacting [admin].]
>
> [Admin name]"

---

### Template: Appeal Response (Granted)

> "[Student],
>
> Thank you for your appeal regarding your removal from The Multiverse School.
>
> After careful review, I'm [overturning / modifying] the removal decision. Here's why:
> [Brief explanation: new evidence, process error, etc.]
>
> Here's what happens next:
> [Specific next steps: immediate return, modified consequence, etc.]
>
> [If modified to include probation: You'll be on probation for [duration] with the following expectations: [list]. Any violations during probation will result in immediate permanent removal.]
>
> [Admin name]"

---

## Common Enforcement Challenges

### Challenge 1: "But They Have Trauma/Disability!"

**The tension:** You don't want to be ableist, but the behavior is still harmful.

**Response framework:**
- Disability explains behavior, it doesn't excuse harm
- Accommodate disability in HOW you respond, not WHETHER
- Removal can still be necessary for community safety

**Script:**
> "I understand [trauma/ADHD/psychosis/etc.] contributes to this behavior. That doesn't change that [specific harm] occurred and is affecting others' safety. We've tried [accommodations provided]. The pattern is continuing. Removal is about safety, not blame."

---

### Challenge 2: "Everyone Loves Them!"

**The tension:** Student is popular/talented, but violating Code of Conduct.

**Response framework:**
- Popularity doesn't exempt anyone
- Others are watching to see if rules apply equally
- Keeping them sends message that some people are above consequences

**Script (to community if there's pushback):**
> "I know [student] is valued in this community. Code of Conduct applies to everyone, regardless of how liked or talented they are. The decision was based on [type of violation, not details], and it's final."

---

### Challenge 3: "They Said They'll Change This Time"

**The tension:** They're very apologetic and promising change. You've heard this before.

**Response framework:**
- Apology doesn't erase pattern
- Change is shown through behavior over time, not promises
- You can acknowledge the apology AND maintain consequences

**Script:**
> "I believe you're genuinely sorry. I also see a pattern:
> - [Date]: [Incident] → apology → repeat
> - [Date]: [Incident] → apology → repeat
> - [Date]: [Incident] → apology → [current situation]
>
> Change isn't shown through apologies. It's shown through sustained different behavior. The consequence stands. If/when you return, you'll have the opportunity to demonstrate change through actions."

---

### Challenge 4: "You're Being Ableist!"

**The tension:** Student accuses you of discrimination when you enforce boundaries.

**Response framework:**
- Listen to the concern seriously
- Distinguish accommodation from enabling
- Consult with team if uncertain
- Stand firm if decision was appropriate

**Script:**
> "I take that concern seriously. Let me explain my reasoning:
>
> [Specific behavior] caused harm to [others/community]. I've accommodated [disability] by [specific accommodations provided]. What I can't accommodate is [the harmful behavior], because [impact].
>
> This isn't about [disability]. It's about [specific behavior and impact]. If you believe this decision was discriminatory, you can appeal to [admin]."

---

### Challenge 5: Enforcer Burnout

**The tension:** You're exhausted. You don't have energy for another difficult conversation.

**Response framework:**
- Enforcement can't depend on your energy level
- Delay briefly if needed, but don't avoid
- Share enforcement responsibilities
- Take breaks after difficult decisions

**Self-care:**
- Debrief with colleagues after enforcement
- Document thoroughly (reduces emotional load)
- Recognize enforcement is part of the job, not failure
- Tag team with admin for particularly draining situations

---

## Transparency vs. Privacy in Enforcement

### General Principles

**From transformative justice and privacy ethics:**

**Always private:**
- Reporter's identity (unless they choose to share)
- Medical/mental health information
- Specific details of investigations
- Personal crises unrelated to violation

**Sometimes shared (with affected parties):**
- That a report was made
- General outcome ("We've addressed this")
- Boundaries put in place that affect them

**Rarely public:**
- Safety warnings (if ongoing risk)
- Disaffiliation (if claiming association post-removal)
- Policy clarifications after pattern emerges

---

### Decision Tree: What to Share

**When enforcement action is taken, ask:**

1. **Does community safety require disclosure?**
   - YES → Share what's necessary for safety
   - NO → Move to #2

2. **Do specific people need to know for their safety?**
   - YES → Tell only those specific people
   - NO → Move to #3

3. **Is there educational value in sharing?**
   - YES → Share de-identified example
   - NO → Keep private

4. **Is silence enabling harm?**
   - YES (person claiming affiliation, recruiting, etc.) → Public statement
   - NO → Keep private

---

### Templates for Different Levels of Disclosure

#### Private (to involved parties only)

> "We've received and investigated your report. We've taken action that we believe addresses the concern. Due to privacy considerations, we can't share specific details about consequences, but we want you to know this was taken seriously."

---

#### Limited (to affected group)

> "You may have noticed [Student] is no longer in [channel/class]. They're no longer participating in this space. We can't share details, but we wanted you to know this was addressed. If you have concerns, please contact [admin]."

---

#### Public (safety warning)

> "[Student name] is no longer affiliated with The Multiverse School. They were removed for violations of our Code of Conduct. If they are recruiting for projects or claiming Multiverse affiliation, please know they are not endorsed by us. Please exercise caution."

---

#### Public (educational, de-identified)

> "We've noticed a pattern of [general behavior: crisis messaging outside hours, boundary violations, etc.]. This is a reminder that [Code of Conduct expectations]. If this is challenging for you, here are resources: [list]. Repeated violations will result in [progressive consequences]."

---

## Maintaining Your Enforcement Capacity

### Why This Matters

**From burnout research:** Enforcement is one of the most draining parts of teaching/admin work. If you don't maintain your capacity, you'll either:
- Avoid enforcement (letting problems escalate)
- Enforce inconsistently (only when you have energy)
- Burn out entirely

---

### Strategies for Sustainable Enforcement

#### 1. Share the Load
- Rotate enforcement responsibilities among admins
- Don't let one person be "the bad guy"
- Consult before major decisions (reduces emotional burden)

#### 2. Document Immediately
- Don't let incidents pile up
- Write it down while memory is fresh
- Reduces anxiety about forgetting details

#### 3. Debrief After Difficult Calls
- Process with colleague or supervisor
- Normalize that enforcement is hard
- Separate your decision from your feelings about it

#### 4. Create Templates
- Standard language for common situations
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Ensures consistency

#### 5. Set Enforcement Hours
- Don't enforce late at night when exhausted
- Better to wait until morning and respond clearly
- Exception: immediate safety concerns

#### 6. Recognize Enforcement as Care
- You're not being mean—you're protecting community
- Boundaries and consequences help students learn
- Removal protects everyone, including the removed person

---

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Be explicit, not vague** — Clear expectations prevent confusion
2. **Enforce consistently** — Same violation = same consequence
3. **Distinguish style from safety** — Neurodivergent ≠ violation
4. **Use progressive discipline** — Except for serious harm
5. **Document everything** — Protects everyone
6. **Separate the what from the why** — Behavior is what you enforce; context affects how
7. **Allow for appeals** — But limit scope
8. **Balance transparency and privacy** — Share what's necessary for safety
9. **Share enforcement load** — Don't burn out
10. **Center transformative justice** — Accountability over punishment

---

## Resources

### Frameworks
- **Transformative Justice** (Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network)
- **Restorative Justice in Schools** (International Institute for Restorative Practices)
- **Disability Justice Principles** (Sins Invalid)
- **Trauma-Informed Discipline** (American University, 2024)

### When You Need Support
- Consult with admin team
- Peer supervision with other teachers
- Legal counsel (for questions about liability, mandatory reporting)
- Disability justice organizations (for questions about ableism vs. boundaries)

---

## Remember

**Enforcement isn't failure—it's care.**

A Code of Conduct protects everyone: the student who needs boundaries, the students who need safety, and you as educator. Consistent, thoughtful enforcement creates a container where learning can happen.

You will face situations that feel impossible: students you care about who need to be removed, community members who disagree with your decisions, moments when you question yourself.

**In those moments, return to:**
- Your documentation (facts ground you)
- Your values (safety, dignity, consistency)
- Your team (you don't decide alone)
- The Code itself (does this align with what we said we'd do?)

> **Guiding principle:** The Code of Conduct exists to make safety predictable and accountability possible. Enforcing it consistently is an act of care for the entire community—including the person facing consequences.
