## Enforcement

### Process
1. **First conversation:** If you violate the Code of Conduct, the instructor will talk with you about what happened and what needs to change
2. **Your response matters:** How you respond to feedback significantly influences consequences
3. **Removal if necessary:** The instructor has sole discretion to remove students for violations
4. **No refunds for violations:** If removed for Code of Conduct violations, you will not receive a refund

### Philosophy
From the instructor (Liz):
> "I have expelled 9 paying students over the years. I prioritize psychological safety over revenue. This community is built on trust, respect, and safety—and I will protect that."

---

## Student Agreement

By enrolling in The Multiverse School, you agree to:

1. **Follow this Code of Conduct**
2. **Accept that the instructor has final say** on removal decisions (no appeals)
3. **Understand that violations may result in removal without refund**
4. **Engage in good faith** with feedback and course correction when issues arise
5. **Respect that fair process means conversation before removal** — you'll have a chance to respond to concerns

## Why These Rules Exist

### Protecting Neurodivergent Students
Many students have experienced:
- Masking exhaustion in other spaces
- Punishment for being "weird" or different
- Discrimination for neurodivergent traits
- Unsafe power dynamics

**These rules create space where:**
- Direct communication is valued
- Stimming, echolalia, and neurodivergent traits are welcome
- You don't have to perform neurotypicality
- Authenticity is encouraged within safety boundaries

### Protecting Marginalized Students
Many students are multiply marginalized:
- Queer, trans, nonbinary
- BIPOC
- Disabled beyond neurodivergence
- Economically marginalized
- Survivors of trauma

**These rules ensure:**
- No hate speech or discrimination
- Respect for all identities
- Safety from harassment
- Inclusive community standards

### Protecting Everyone's Learning
Clear rules about:
- Not monopolizing space
- Respecting the instructor
- Ethical behavior
- Privacy

**These create an environment where:**
- Everyone can learn
- Mistakes are okay
- Growth is supported
- Safety is maintained

---

## Differences from Generic Codes of Conduct

### What Makes This Different

**1. Neurodivergence-affirming:**
- Direct communication is explicitly valued
- "Weird" is celebrated (in appropriate contexts)
- Authenticity over professionalism
- Body doubling and stimming are normalized

**2. Explicitly anti-authoritarian:**
- "No cops" is a stated value
- Privacy and trust are prioritized
- Power dynamics are acknowledged

**3. Realistic about adult humans:**
- "Weirdness" has a time and place
- Acknowledges that people have lives/identities outside class
- Boundaries are flexible but clear

**4. Prioritizes psychological safety over comfort:**
- Hate speech is banned, period
- Uncomfortable conversations about justice are welcome
- Growth requires some discomfort

## How to Use This as a Teacher/Moderator

### When Enforcing
1. **Reference specific rule violated**
   - "You talked over me three times in class today. That violates our Code of Conduct."

2. **Explain impact**
   - "When you monopolize discussion, others don't get to participate."

3. **State expectation**
   - "Going forward, I need you to [specific behavior change]."

4. **Assess response**
   - Receptive and apologetic? → Continue with warning
   - Defensive and combative? → May need removal

### When Students Ask "Why is this a rule?"

**Transparency is key:**
- "This rule exists because [specific harm it prevents]"
- "We learned we needed this rule when [anonymized example]"
- "This protects [specific population]"

### When Rules Conflict with Neurodivergence

**Example:** Student with ADHD repeatedly talks over instructor

**Address behavior, not diagnosis:**
> "I notice you're interrupting frequently. I know ADHD makes waiting really hard. Here's what I can offer: I'll call on you first when I pause, and you practice raising your hand instead of interrupting. Deal?"

**Accommodation ≠ Exemption from all rules**

## Updating This Code

### Living Document
This Code of Conduct evolves based on:
- Community needs
- Incidents that reveal gaps
- Feedback from students
- Changes in cultural context

### Major Changes

## Remember

**The Code of Conduct exists to make space for authenticity, learning, and safety—all at once.**

You can be:
- Weird AND respectful
- Direct AND kind
- Boundaried AND connected
- Authentic AND ethical

> **Guiding principle:** "Be excellent to each other" means creating a space where everyone—especially marginalized and neurodivergent people—can learn, grow, and belong without experiencing harm, harassment, or discrimination.
