# Cohabitation Policy: Living with Other Multiverse Members

## The Bottom Line Up Front

**Visiting people is fine. Living together is complicated and risky.**

If you choose to live with another Multiverse member, understand:
- **Your relationship is with that person, not The Multiverse School**
- **We are not responsible for what happens when you cohabitate**
- **Staff/teachers/admins/mentors CANNOT live with students/mentees**

---

## Why This Is a Policy

### Living Together Gets Messy

**Common issues that arise:**
- Rent disputes
- Cleanliness conflicts
- Boundaries violated
- One person feels exploited
- Power dynamics become toxic
- Romantic entanglements gone wrong
- Someone gets kicked out with nowhere to go

**When this happens:**
- It's between you and your housemate
- The Multiverse School cannot mediate or resolve it
- We will not take sides
- We will not remove someone from the school because your living situation fell apart

**You take that risk when you choose to live together.**

---

## Absolute Prohibitions

### Staff/Teachers/Admins/Formal Mentors Cannot Live with Students/Mentees

**Who this applies to:**
- Anyone who teaches a class at Multiverse
- Anyone in an admin role
- Anyone who is paid by The Multiverse School
- Anyone perceived as staff
- Anyone in a formal mentorship relationship

**Why this is banned:**
- The power imbalance makes it inappropriate
- It creates conflicts of interest
- It never goes well
- It's weird and ends up being hard for everyone

**Consequences of violation:**
- Staff member will be removed from their position
- Mentorship relationship will be terminated
- Both parties may be removed from the school if the situation is egregious

**No exceptions. Ever.**

## General Community Members Living Together

### You Can, But...

**The Multiverse School's position:**
- We don't prohibit community members from living together
- We also don't endorse or facilitate it
- We are not responsible for what happens

**Before you live with a Multiverse member, ask yourself:**

1. **Do we have a written agreement about:**
   - Rent and utilities (who pays what, when)?
   - How long the arrangement lasts?
   - What happens if one person wants to leave?
   - Cleanliness and shared space expectations?
   - Boundaries (guests, noise, personal space)?

2. **What happens if this goes badly?**
   - Do I have a backup plan for housing?
   - Can I afford to move out suddenly if needed?
   - Will this destroy our relationship?

3. **Can I handle conflict with this person?**
   - Have we successfully resolved disagreements before?
   - Do I trust them to be reasonable if issues arise?
   - Am I prepared to set boundaries and enforce them?

**If your answer to any of these is uncertain, reconsider.**

## Common Scenarios & What Happens

### Scenario 1: "My Housemate Isn't Paying Rent"

**What you can do:**
- Talk to them directly
- Create a written payment agreement going forward
- Ask them to leave (if you're on the lease)
- Take legal action if necessary

**What The Multiverse School will do:**
- Nothing. This is between you and your housemate.

**What The Multiverse School will NOT do:**
- Remove them from the school because they owe you money
- Force them to pay you
- Mediate your rent dispute
- Take sides

---

### Scenario 2: "We Dated and Broke Up, Now Living Together Is Awful"

**What you can do:**
- One person moves out
- Create boundaries about shared space until someone can leave
- Find subletter or new housing

**What The Multiverse School will do:**
- Nothing. Your romantic relationship is separate from the school.

**What The Multiverse School will NOT do:**
- Remove your ex from the school
- Force one of you to move
- Mediate your breakup
- Create separate class sections so you don't see each other

---

### Scenario 3: "My Housemate Is Creating an Unsafe Environment"

**If "unsafe" means:**
- **Violent behavior, threats, abuse:** Call police, seek domestic violence resources, get out
- **Code of Conduct violations in shared space:** You can report the Code of Conduct violation separately, but the housing dispute isn't our issue
- **Just an asshole/messy/difficult:** You need to set boundaries or move out

**What The Multiverse School will do:**
- Address Code of Conduct violations if reported and verified (separate from housing)
- Provide crisis resources if you're in danger

**What The Multiverse School will NOT do:**
- Force them to move out of a place they're legally residing
- Solve your personal conflict
- Remove them from school because you're unhappy with living arrangements

---

### Scenario 4: "A Teacher/Staff Member is Living with a Student"

**What you should do:**
- Report this to Liz immediately

**What The Multiverse School will do:**
- Investigate
- Remove the staff member from their position
- Potentially remove both parties depending on circumstances

**This is the ONE housing situation we will act on, because it violates our policy.**

## When Cohabitation Becomes a School Issue

### We WILL Get Involved If:

1. **Staff is living with students** (policy violation)
2. **Code of Conduct is violated** (separate from housing dispute)
   - Harassment, hate speech, violence, etc.
   - Evaluated same as any other Code of Conduct violation
3. **Criminal activity involving Multiverse members**
   - We may need to cooperate with authorities
   - May result in removal for safety

### We WILL NOT Get Involved In:

1. **Rent/money disputes** between housemates
2. **Breakups** or romantic drama
3. **Personality conflicts** in shared housing
4. **Cleanliness disagreements**
5. **Guest policy conflicts**
6. **Noise complaints**
7. **General roommate incompatibility**

**These are between you and your housemate. Handle them like adults.**

## Visiting vs. Living Together

### Visiting Is Fine

**Visiting includes:**
- Staying for a few days or a week
- Short-term hosting while traveling
- Temporary arrangement with clear end date

**No policy issues with visiting.**

---

### When Does It Become "Living Together"?

**Living together means:**
- Staying for more than 2-3 weeks consecutively
- Receiving mail at the address
- Paying rent/contributing to household expenses
- No clear departure date
- Sharing responsibilities (groceries, chores, etc.)

**Once it becomes living together, this policy applies.**

---

## Best Practices If You Do Live Together

### 1. Put It in Writing

**Create a written agreement that includes:**
- Rent/utilities split and payment dates
- Length of arrangement ("Month to month" or "Until [date]")
- Notice period if someone wants to leave (30 days, etc.)
- Household responsibilities
- Guest policies
- What happens if conflict arises

**Even a simple email exchange counts.**

**Template:**
> "To confirm our housing arrangement:
> - You're staying at [address] from [start date] to [end date/month-to-month]
> - Rent is $[amount], due on [day of month]
> - Utilities split [50/50, included in rent, etc.]
> - Either of us can end this arrangement with 30 days notice
> - If disputes arise, we'll [handle it ourselves/use mediation/etc.]
>
> Sound good?"

### 2. Maintain Other Relationships

**Don't make your housemate your ONLY social connection.**

- Keep friendships outside the household
- Attend Multiverse events separately (sometimes)
- Have your own life beyond shared space

**Why:** If the living situation goes bad, you need other support.

---

### 3. Address Issues Early

**Don't let resentment build.**

- Speak up when boundaries are crossed
- Address money issues immediately
- Talk about cleanliness/chores before it's explosive

**Waiting makes it worse.**

---

### 4. Have an Exit Plan

**Before moving in, know:**
- Where you'd go if this doesn't work out
- How much money you need to move (deposit, first month, moving costs)
- Whether you can afford to leave

**Don't move in with someone if leaving would be impossible.**

---

## Power Dynamics & Vulnerable People

### Extra Caution Needed When:

**One person has significantly more power/resources:**
- One person owns the property; the other doesn't
- One person makes significantly more money
- One person is housing insecure with no other options
- One person is dependent (disabled, unemployed, isolated)

**Why this is risky:**
- The person with less power may feel they can't leave
- The person with more power may exploit the imbalance
- "Gifts" of housing can become tools of control

**If this describes your situation:**
- Extra important to have written agreements
- Extra important to have an exit plan
- Extra important to maintain outside support network

---

## Special Note: Staff Must Not Create Housing Dependency

**Staff/teachers should NEVER:**
- Offer housing to students in crisis
- Move in with students even temporarily
- Use housing as leverage

**Why:**
- Power imbalance makes it inappropriate
- Creates obligation and dependency
- Opens staff to accusations or exploitation claims

**If a student needs housing help:**
- Refer to shelters, transitional housing, social services
- Point to community mutual aid (not yourself personally)
- Maintain professional boundaries

---

## Romantic Relationships & Housing

### Extra Layer of Complexity

**If you're dating/considering dating someone, DO NOT:**
- Move in immediately
- Move in without exit plan
- Assume love will solve logistical issues

**If you live together and then start dating:**
- Recognize the risks
- Keep finances separate if possible
- Know what you'd do if you break up

**If you live together and break up:**
- One person needs to move out (usually)
- Have plan for who stays, who goes
- Honor any written agreements you made

**The Multiverse School's position on romantic cohabitation:**
- We don't prohibit it
- We think it's usually a bad idea for new relationships
- We definitely won't mediate your breakup drama

---

## Key Principles

1. **Your relationship is with your housemate, not the school** — We're not responsible for housing arrangements
2. **Staff CANNOT live with students** — Absolute prohibition, no exceptions
3. **Put it in writing** — Agreements prevent disputes
4. **Have an exit plan** — Know how you'd leave if needed
5. **Address issues early** — Don't let resentment build
6. **Maintain boundaries** — Even with housemates
7. **The school will not mediate** — Handle disputes like adults

---

## Remember

**Living with people is one of the hardest relationships to navigate.** Add in power dynamics, financial stress, neurodivergence, mental health challenges, and romantic entanglements, and it gets exponentially messier.

**We're not saying you can't do it.** We're saying:
- Be smart about it
- Protect yourself
- Know the risks
- Don't expect the school to rescue you when it goes wrong

> **Guiding principle:** Visiting builds connection. Living together builds resentment—unless you have crystal-clear boundaries, written agreements, and exit plans. The Multiverse School is a learning community, not a housing mediator. Choose your housemates wisely, because we won't save you from bad choices.
