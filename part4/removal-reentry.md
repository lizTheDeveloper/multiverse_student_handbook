# Removal & Re-entry Guidelines

## Purpose

This guide explains when and how people are removed from The Multiverse School, and under what conditions they may return. Understanding this helps you know what behaviors cross the line and what happens if you (or someone else) needs a community pause.

**Core principle:** Removal is not punishment—it's recognition that someone cannot participate safely at this time.

**Why you should know this:** Transparency about consequences helps everyone participate safely. If you're ever asked to pause your participation, you'll understand why and what's needed to return.

## When Removal is Necessary

### Immediate Removal (No Warning)

**Remove immediately and permanently for:**
- **Violence or credible threats of violence**
- **Sexual harassment or predatory behavior**
- **Doxxing or sharing private information to harm others**
- **Recruiting members for dangerous/exploitative projects** (cults, pyramid schemes, unsafe living situations)
- **Stalking or sustained harassment** across platforms
- **Intentional sabotage** of community infrastructure

**Process:** Admin decision, document thoroughly, public disaffiliation if necessary to protect others

---

### Immediate Temporary Removal (Pending Assessment)

**Remove temporarily (pause participation) for:**
- **Active psychosis** that's disrupting community or putting others at risk
- **Manic episode** with grandiose recruiting or boundary violations
- **Suicidal crisis** where engagement with community is escalating distress
- **Acute mental health emergency** beyond community capacity

**Process:**
- Admin contacts student directly
- Provide crisis resources
- Clear communication: "We need you to take a pause while you get support. We care about you and this space isn't safe for you right now."
- Timeline: Reassess when student provides proof of treatment engagement and stabilization

---

### Progressive Removal (After Warnings)

**Remove after 2-3 clear warnings for:**
- **Repeated boundary violations** despite feedback
- **Crisis dependency** that doesn't improve with boundaries
- **Manipulation or emotional coercion**
- **Consistent disruption** of learning environment
- **Refusal to respect Code of Conduct** after being told specific violations

**Process:**
1. First boundary violation: Clear communication, documentation
2. Second violation: Warning with consequences stated
3. Third violation: Temporary or permanent removal

---

## Types of Removal

### Temporary Pause (Most Common)
**Duration:** 2 weeks to 6 months
**Purpose:** Give student time to stabilize, get treatment, or address specific issues
**Re-entry:** Possible with demonstrated change

**Examples:**
- Student in mental health crisis → pause until stabilized
- Repeated boundary violations → pause until they can commit to respecting boundaries
- Premature transcendence → pause pending 90-Day Track completion

---

### Permanent Removal
**Duration:** Indefinite
**Purpose:** Protect community from ongoing harm
**Re-entry:** Rarely, only in exceptional circumstances

**Examples:**
- Violence or credible threats
- Sexual harassment
- Repeated manipulation after multiple chances
- False claims of harm to retaliate against staff/students
- Sustained pattern of violations without change

---

### Conditional Participation
**Not full removal, but restrictions:**
- Muted in certain channels
- Can attend class but can't submit assignments
- Access to resources but not live sessions
- Probationary period with clear expectations

**When to use:** Student needs support but full participation isn't safe yet

## The Removal Conversation

### How to Communicate Removal

**Template for temporary removal:**
> "[Student Name],
>
> I'm writing to let you know that we need to pause your participation in The Multiverse School, effective immediately.
>
> Here's why: [Specific, factual reasons. Examples: repeated boundary violations, crisis behavior that we're not equipped to support, violations of Code of Conduct]
>
> Specific incidents:
> - [Date]: [What happened]
> - [Date]: [What happened]
> - [Date]: [What happened]
>
> This isn't rejection or punishment. It's recognition that right now, this space isn't the right fit, or you need support we can't provide.
>
> **What happens now:**
> - You won't have access to [classes, Discord, etc.] during this pause
> - The pause is for [timeframe: 2 weeks, 3 months, until X condition is met]
> - Here are resources for support during this time: [list]
>
> **How you can return:**
> [Specific, measurable conditions. Examples: evidence of therapy engagement, completion of 90-Day Track, written commitment to boundaries]
>
> We want you to be able to participate when you're ready. This pause creates space for that readiness.
>
> [Admin name]"

---

### Template for permanent removal:
> "[Student Name],
>
> I'm writing to inform you that you are permanently removed from The Multiverse School, effective immediately.
>
> Here's why: [Specific, serious violations]
>
> Specific incidents:
> - [Date]: [What happened]
> - [Date]: [What happened]
>
> We've [addressed this with you X times / provided warnings / offered support], and the pattern has continued or escalated.
>
> This decision is final. You will not be able to return to Multiverse.
>
> [If applicable: We are also publicly disaffiliating you, meaning we will clarify to our community that you are not affiliated with us and we do not endorse your projects/behavior.]
>
> If you have questions, you can email [contact], but this decision will not be reversed.
>
> [Admin name]"

---

## Re-entry Process

### Step 1: Student Initiates Contact
Student emails admin requesting re-entry:
> "I'd like to return to Multiverse. I've [done X, Y, Z that was required]. Can we talk about re-entry?"

---

### Step 2: Admin Assessment
**Questions to ask:**

1. **Has enough time passed?**
   - Minimum 2 weeks for temporary removals
   - Assess: Is this request premature?

2. **Have they met the conditions?**
   - If condition was "complete 90-Day Track," did they?
   - If condition was "proof of therapy," can they provide it?
   - If condition was "written commitment to boundaries," have they submitted it?

3. **What's changed?**
   - Ask directly: "What's different now from when you were removed?"
   - Look for: accountability, self-awareness, concrete changes
   - Red flags: blaming others, minimizing behavior, no acknowledgment of harm

4. **Is it safe for the community?**
   - Would their return cause harm or fear?
   - Do other students need to be warned/consulted?
   - Is the behavior likely to recur?

5. **What support structures are in place?**
   - Are they in therapy?
   - Do they have external support systems?
   - What will prevent the same pattern?

---

### Step 3: Re-entry Conversation (If Appropriate)

**Template:**
> "Thanks for reaching out. I want to understand what's changed since we paused your participation.
>
> When you were removed, the issues were: [specific issues].
>
> What's different now? What have you learned or worked on?"

**Listen for:**
- **Accountability:** "I understand why my behavior was problematic"
- **Growth:** "I've been in therapy and working on X"
- **Realistic expectations:** "I know I'll need to earn trust back"
- **External support:** "I have a therapist/support system now"

**Red flags:**
- "Everyone was overreacting"
- "You didn't give me a fair chance"
- "I wasn't that bad"
- "It was because of X" (external blame, no ownership)
- Immediate demands or entitlement

---

### Step 4: Decision

**If re-entry is granted:**

**Probationary Period (Recommended):**
- 30-90 days with clear expectations
- More frequent check-ins
- One strike policy: if the pattern recurs, permanent removal

**Template:**
> "[Student],
>
> Based on our conversation and the work you've done, we're open to you rejoining The Multiverse School.
>
> Here's what that looks like:
> - **Probationary period:** [30/60/90 days]
> - **Expectations:** [Specific, clear expectations. Examples: respect communication boundaries, use crisis resources not teachers, complete 90-Day Track, etc.]
> - **Check-ins:** We'll check in at [Week 2, Week 4, Week 8]
> - **One strike:** If the previous pattern recurs, removal will be immediate and permanent.
>
> We're glad to have you back and we want this to work. Welcome back.
>
> [Admin]"

---

**If re-entry is denied:**

**Template:**
> "[Student],
>
> Thank you for reaching out. After careful consideration, we've decided that re-entry isn't appropriate at this time.
>
> Here's why: [Specific reasons. Examples: not enough time has passed, conditions weren't met, pattern indicates likely recurrence, community safety concerns]
>
> You may re-apply in [X months/never, depending on situation].
>
> We wish you well.
>
> [Admin]"

## Special Circumstances

### Re-entry After Mental Health Crisis
**If removed during active psychosis, mania, or suicidal crisis:**

**Requirements for return:**
- Proof of treatment (letter from therapist/doctor stating they're stable and can participate)
- Time passed (minimum 30 days from crisis)
- Student can articulate what happened and what support they now have

**Not required:**
- Disclosure of diagnosis
- Details of treatment
- Promise to "never have a crisis again"

**Why this matters:** Mental health crises aren't moral failures. If someone got help and stabilized, they deserve another chance.

---

### Re-entry After Premature Transcendence
**If removed for trying to recruit/start projects without completing 90-Day Track:**

**Requirements:**
- Completion of full 90-Day Visionary Incubation Track
- Demonstrated follow-through (submitted work, attended check-ins)
- No recruitment during the 90 days
- Final meeting with mentor/admin

**If granted:**
- Return with mentorship for their project (if appropriate)
- Clear boundaries about recruitment and affiliation

---

### Re-entry After Boundary Violations
**If removed for repeated boundary violations (crisis dependency, love-bombing, excessive contact):**

**Requirements:**
- Written commitment to specific boundaries
- Evidence of external support (therapy, support groups, etc.)
- Understanding of what went wrong (not just "I'll do better")
- Accountability for impact on others

**Probationary expectations:**
- Strict adherence to stated boundaries
- One violation = permanent removal

---

## Communicating Removals to the Community

### Public vs. Private

**Always private:**
- Mental health crises
- Personal struggles (housing, addiction, trauma)
- First-time boundary violations

**Sometimes public (limited info):**
- If student had high visibility and disappears suddenly
- Template: "[Student] is no longer participating in Multiverse. We can't share details out of respect for their privacy."

**Always public:**
- If student is recruiting members or claiming affiliation after removal
- If their behavior poses risk to others
- Template: "[Student] is not affiliated with The Multiverse School. We do not endorse their projects. They were removed for [general reason: repeated boundary violations / safety concerns]. Please exercise caution."

---

## Documentation Requirements

**For every removal, document:**
- Date and time of decision
- Specific incidents with dates
- What conditions were communicated for return (if applicable)
- Who made the decision (admin + teachers consulted)
- Any communications with the student

**Store securely:** Private admin folder, not public channels

---

## Appeals Process

**Students may appeal removal under these conditions:**
- They believe the removal was based on false information
- They can provide evidence of circumstances not previously considered
- They believe the process wasn't followed

**Process:**
1. Student emails appeal to [designated admin, not the person who removed them if possible]
2. Admin reviews all documentation
3. Consults with team
4. Decision within 7 days
5. Decision is final

**Not grounds for appeal:**
- "I disagree with your interpretation"
- "That's not fair"
- "Other people do worse and don't get removed"

---

## Self-Care for Staff

### Removing students is hard

You may feel:
- Guilt ("Am I abandoning them?")
- Doubt ("Did I make the right call?")
- Grief (especially if you cared about the student)
- Fear (What if they retaliate?)

**What helps:**
- Debrief with team
- Review documentation (facts ground you)
- Remember: You're protecting the community
- Consult mentor or supervisor
- Take time off if needed

**From transformative justice:** Accountability can include removal. That's not failure—it's responsibility.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Removal is not punishment** — It's recognition of mismatch or harm
2. **Safety over sentiment** — Community protection comes first
3. **Clear conditions** — Students deserve to know what's required for return
4. **Second chances when appropriate** — But not infinite chances
5. **Document everything** — Protects everyone
6. **Consistency matters** — Same violations = same consequences
7. **Re-entry is earned** — Not automatic, not guaranteed

---

## Quick Decision Tree

**Is there immediate danger or severe harm?**
→ YES: Immediate permanent removal

**Is this a mental health crisis?**
→ YES: Temporary removal + crisis resources + offer of return when stable

**Have they been warned?**
→ NO: First warning with clear consequences stated
→ YES, once: Second warning, document, consider temporary pause
→ YES, multiple times: Removal (temporary or permanent depending on severity)

**Is this pattern likely to change?**
→ YES (with support): Temporary removal with clear re-entry conditions
→ NO: Permanent removal

---

## Remember

Removal protects three groups:
1. **The student** (from a situation they can't handle healthily)
2. **Other students** (from harm, disruption, or resource depletion)
3. **Staff** (from unsustainable demands)

**All three matter.** Removal is an act of care for the whole ecosystem.

> **Guiding principle:** You can care about someone's wellbeing AND remove them from your community. Both can be true. Both might be necessary.
